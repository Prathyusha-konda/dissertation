abstract = {Translation is the fundamental biological process converting mRNA information into proteins. Single-molecule imaging in live cells has illuminated the dynamics of RNA transcription; however, it is not yet applicable to translation. Here, we report single-molecule imaging of nascent peptides (SINAPS) to assess translation in live cells. The approach provides direct readout of initiation, elongation, and location of translation. We show that mRNAs coding for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins are translated when they encounter the ER membrane. Single-molecule fluorescence recovery after photobleaching provides direct measurement of elongation speed (5 amino acids per second). In primary neurons, mRNAs are translated in proximal dendrites but repressed in distal dendrites and display "bursting" translation. This technology provides a tool with which to address the spatiotemporal translation mechanism of single mRNAs in living cells.

abstract = {We develop a new framework for inferring models of transcriptional regulation. The models, which we call physical network models, are annotated molecular interaction graphs. The attributes in the model correspond to verifiable properties of the underlying biological system such as the existence of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, the directionality of signal transduction in protein-protein interactions, as well as signs of the immediate effects of these interactions. Possible configurations of these variables are constrained by the available data sources. Some of the data sources, such as factor-binding data, involve measurements that are directly tied to the variables in the model. Other sources, such as gene knock-outs, are functional in nature and provide only indirect evidence about the variables. We associate each observed knock-out effect in the deletion mutant data with a set of causal paths (molecular cascades) that could in principle explain the effect, resulting in aggregate constraints about the physical variables in the model. The most likely settings of all the variables, specifying the most likely graph annotations, are found by a recursive application of the max-product algorithm. By testing our approach on datasets related to the pheromone response pathway in S. cerevisiae, we demonstrate that the resulting model is consistent with previous studies about the pathway. Moreover, we successfully predict gene knock-out effects with a high degree of accuracy in a cross-validation setting. When applying this approach genome-wide, we extract submodels consistent with previous studies. The approach can be readily extended to other data sources or to facilitate automated experimental design.},

abstract = {The neuronal function of Cys-loop neurotransmitter receptors is established; however, their role in non-neuronal cells is poorly defined. As brain tumors are enriched in the neurotransmitter glycine, we studied the expression and function of glycine receptors (GlyRs) in glioma cells. Human brain tumor biopsies selectively expressed the GlyR $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$3 subunits, which have nuclear localization signals (NLSs). The mouse glioma cell line GL261 expressed GlyR $\alpha$1, and knockdown of GlyR $\alpha$1 protein expression impaired the self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity of GL261 glioma cells, as shown by a neurosphere assay and GL261 cell inoculation in vivo, respectively. We furthermore showed that the pronounced tumorigenic effect of GlyR $\alpha$1 relies on a new intracellular signaling function that depends on the NLS region in the large cytosolic loop and impacts on GL261 glioma cell gene regulation. Stable expression of GlyR $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$3 loops rescued the self-renewal capacity of GlyR $\alpha$1 knockdown cells, which demonstrates their functional equivalence. The new intracellular signaling function identified here goes beyond the well-established role of GlyRs as neuronal ligand-gated ion channels and defines NLS-containing GlyRs as new potential targets for brain tumor therapies.},

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging View full abstract},

abstract = {The distribution of isoelectric point (pI) of proteins in a proteome is universal for all organisms. It is bimodal dividing the proteome into two sets of acidic and basic proteins. Different species however have different abundance of acidic and basic proteins that may be correlated with taxonomy, subcellular localization, ecological niche of organisms and proteome size. We have analysed 1784 proteomes encoded by chromosomes of Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, and also mitochondria, plastids, prokaryotic plasmids, phages and viruses. We have found significant correlation in more than 95% of proteomes between the protein length and pI in proteomes {\textendash} positive for acidic proteins and negative for the basic ones. Plastids, viruses and plasmids encode more basic proteomes while chromosomes of Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, mitochondria and phages more acidic ones. Mitochondrial proteomes of Viridiplantae, Protista and Fungi are more basic than Metazoa. It results from the presence of basic proteins in the former proteomes and their absence from the latter ones and is related with reduction of metazoan genomes. Significant correlation was found between the pI bias of proteomes encoded by prokaryotic chromosomes and proteomes encoded by plasmids but there is no correlation between eukaryotic nuclear-coded proteomes and proteomes encoded by organelles. Detailed analyses of prokaryotic proteomes showed significant relationships between pI distribution and habitat, relation to the host cell and salinity of the environment, but no significant correlation with oxygen and temperature requirements. The salinity is positively correlated with acidicity of proteomes. Host-associated organisms and especially intracellular species have more basic proteomes than free-living ones. The higher rate of mutations accumulation in the intracellular parasites and endosymbionts is responsible for the basicity of their tiny proteomes that explains the observed positive correlation between the decrease of genome size and the increase of basicity of proteomes. The results indicate that even conserved proteins subjected to strong selectional constraints follow the global trend in the pI distribution. The distribution of pI of proteins in proteomes shows clear relationships with length of proteins, subcellular localization, taxonomy and ecology of organisms. The distribution is also strongly affected by mutational pressure especially in intracellular organisms.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen an explosive increase in information about regulation of eukaryotic gene transcription, especially for protein-coding genes. The most striking advances in our knowledge of transcriptional regulation involve the chromatin template, the large complexes recruited by transcriptional activators that regulate chromatin structure and the transcription apparatus, the holoenzyme forms of RNA polymerase II involved in initiation and elongation, and the mechanisms that link mRNA processing with its synthesis. We describe here the major advances in these areas, with particular emphasis on the modular complexes associated with RNA polymerase II that are targeted by activators and other regulators of mRNA biosynthesis.},

A structural alignments database indicates residue equivalencies in superimposed protein domain structures. The PDB sequence-map files provide a linkage between the amino acid sequence of the molecule studied (SEQRES records in a database entry) and the sequence of the atoms experimentally observed in the structure (ATOM records). These maps are combined with information in the SCOPdatabase to provide sequences of protein domains.

Figure 1.
A. Probe, complementary sequences for CO-ISFH
B. Use BrdU incorporation to distinguish between newly synthesized sister chromatids. The newly syntehsized strand is eaten away and only the original one is kept. The probe tells you which ORIGINAL strand was segregated.
C-I, open arrowhead = Cy3, filled arrowhead=Cy5. Asterisk = hub. Top, showing different modes of segregation of one probe at a time. Bottom, showing different modes of segretation for two probes at a time. EVen though overall, see {\textasciitilde}85:15 of hub GSC:Gonioblast distribution within just X and Y independently, they seem to independently segregate.
Bottom table: what would be expected given the percentages observed from the individual X and Y CO-FISH.

Figure 2.
A-D.  Chromosome 2 and 3 CO-FISH. See almost all samples with template,template or new,new strands in cells next to hub.
E-F. Chr 2 and Y CO-FISH. Mostly the red strand is inherited with either Chr2 strands in the cells next to hub.
G. Figure summarizing the bias of Y "red" in hub cells.

Figure 3.
A,B: centrosomin (cnn) mutant has equal segregation.
C,D: SUN domain Koi mutant (involved in tethering nucleus to cytoskeletal components(, also has equal segregation. 
Where is klar in this figure???

Don't see disruption in amounts of GSC proliferation/depletion

Figure 4.
A, B. Overexpression of UPD also disrupts biased segregation. UPD: jak/stat signaling. Confuses the cells so that the mother cell doesn't know it's a mother cell anymore.
C-D. Differentaited GSCs, then dedifferentiated them. In dedifferentiated cells, also see disruption of biased segregation. =={\&}gt; biased segregation is not a marker of pluripotency.
E. Suggested biological mechanism using the SUN-KASH complex (Koi)},

abstract = {DNA microarray analysis was combined with a modified single-cell PCR procedure to study gene expression profiles of single cells at different stages of pancreatic development. This method identifies distinct cell types at embryonic day 10.5, a stage when the pancreatic epithelium is morphologically uniform. Some cells express unexpected combinations of genes, and these expression patterns provide new insights into pancreas development. Following on these findings, we use PCR products from different cell types to identify novel pancreatic genes, some of which mark subtypes of developing pancreatic cells. By integrating these data with previous genetic and biochemical studies, we propose a pathway for pancreatic cell development. This form of single-cell transcriptional analysis can be applied to any developmental process or tissue to characterize distinct cell types.},

abstract = {Comparison of the sequences of mouse and human genomes revealed a surprising number of nonexonic, nonexpressed conserved sequences, for which no function could be assigned. To study the possible correlation between these conserved intronic sequences and alternative splicing regulation, we developed a method to identify exons that are alternatively spliced in both human and mouse. We compiled two exon sets: one of alternatively spliced conserved exons and another of constitutively spliced conserved exons. We found that 77% of the conserved alternatively spliced exons were flanked on both sides by long conserved intronic sequences. In comparison, only 17% of the conserved constitutively spliced exons were flanked by such conserved intronic sequences. The average length of the conserved intronic sequences was 103 bases in the upstream intron and 94 bases in the downstream intron. The average identity levels in the immediately flanking intronic sequences were 88% and 80% for the upstream and downstream introns, respectively, higher than the conservation levels of 77% that were measured in promoter regions. Our results suggest that the function of many of the intronic sequence blocks that are conserved between human and mouse is the regulation of alternative splicing.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity of multiparameter data collection and analysis in flow cytometry and the development of relatively inexpensive arc-lamp-based flow cytometers, which increases the probability that laboratories or institutions may have more than one type of instrument, creates a need for shareable analysis programs and for the transport of flow cytometric data files within an installation or from one institution to another. To address this need, we propose a standard file format to be used for all flow cytometric data. The general principles of this proposal are: (1) The data file will contain a minimum of three segments, TEXT, DATA, and ANALYSIS; (2) The TEXT and ANALYSIS segments consist of KEYWORDS, which are the names of data fields, and their values; (3) All TEXT is encoded in ASCII; (4) KEYWORDS and their values may be of any length; (5) Certain KEYWORDS will be standard, i.e., having specified formats to be recognized by all programs. The structure of the DATA segment will be uniquely defined by the values of KEYWORDS in the TEXT area. It may be in any bit resolution, facilitating compatibility between machines with different word length and/or allowing bit compression of the data. The structured nature of the TEXT area should facilitate management of flow cytometric data using existing data base management systems. The proposed file format has been implemented on VAX, PDP-11, and HP9920 based flow cytometry data acquisition systems.},

By combining mRNA-Seq and EST-cDNA sequence data, we estimate that transcripts from approximately 95% of multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing and that there are approximately 100,000 intermediate- to high-abundance alternative splicing events in major human tissues. From a comparison with quantitative alternative splicing microarray profiling data, we also show that mRNA-Seq data provide reliable measurements for exon inclusion levels.},

abstract = {The torrent of RNA-seq data becoming available not only furnishes an overview of the entire transcriptome but also provides tools to focus on specific areas of interest. Our focus on the synthesis of ribosomes asked whether the abundance of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) matched the equimolar need for the RPs in the assembly of ribosomes. We were at first surprised to find, in the mapping data of ENCODE and other sources, that there were nearly 100-fold differences in the level of the mRNAs encoding the different RPs. However, after correcting for the mapping ambiguities introduced by the presence of more than 2000 pseudogenes derived from RP mRNAs, we show that for 80%-90% of the RP genes, the molar ratio of mRNAs varies less than threefold, with little tissue specificity. Nevertheless, since the RPs are needed in equimolar amounts, there must be sluggish or regulated translation of the more abundant RP mRNAs and/or substantial turnover of unused RPs. In addition, seven of the RPs have subsidiary genes, three of which are pseudogenes that have been "rescued" by the introduction of promoters and/or upstream introns. Several of these are transcribed in a tissue-specific manner, e.g., RPL10L in testis and RPL3L in muscle, leading to potential variation in ribosome structure from one tissue to another. Of the 376 introns in the RP genes, a single one is alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner.},

abstract = {The human erythrocyte (red blood cell, RBC) demonstrates extraordinary ability to undergo reversible large deformation and fluidity. Such mechanical response cannot be consistently rationalized on the basis of fixed connectivity of the cell cytoskeleton that comprises the spectrin molecular network tethered to phospholipid membrane. Active topological remodeling of spectrin network has been postulated, although detailed models of such dynamic reorganization are presently unavailable. Here we present a coarse-grained cytoskeletal dynamics simulation with breakable protein associations to elucidate the roles of shear stress, specific chemical agents, and thermal fluctuations in cytoskeleton remodeling. We demonstrate a clear solid-to-fluid transition depending on the metabolic energy influx. The solid network's plastic deformation also manifests creep and yield regimes depending on the strain rate. This cytoskeletal dynamics model offers a means to resolve long-standing questions regarding the reference state used in RBC elasticity theory for determining the equilibrium shape and deformation response. In addition, the simulations offer mechanistic insights into the onset of plasticity and void percolation in cytoskeleton. These phenomena may have implication for RBC membrane loss and shape change in the context of hereditary hemolytic disorders such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis.},

Created in 2000 as a worldwide resource for gene expression studies, GEO has evolved with rapidly changing technologies and now accepts high-throughput data for many other data applications, including those that examine genome methylation, chromatin structure, and genome-protein interactions. GEO supports community-derived reporting standards that specify provision of several critical study elements including raw data, processed data, and descriptive metadata. The database not only provides access to data for tens of thousands of studies, but also offers various Web-based tools and strategies that enable users to locate data relevant to their specific interests, as well as to visualize and analyze the data. This chapter includes detailed descriptions of methods to query and download GEO data and use the analysis and visualization tools. The GEO homepage is at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.},

abstract = {Single-cell RT-PCR was used to sample CD19(+) B cell repertoires in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or viral meningitis. Analysis of amplified Ab H and L chain products served to identify the rearranged germline segment and J segment, and to determine the degree of homology for the H and L chain sequence of individual B cells. The B cell repertoire of viral meningitis CSF was predominantly polyclonal, whereas B cell clonal expansion was a prominent feature of the IgG repertoire in three of four MS patients. Two dominant clonal populations in one MS CSF accounted for approximately 70% of the IgG H chain V regions sequenced, while the corresponding IgM repertoires were more heterogeneous. One clonal B cell population revealed multiple L chain rearrangements, raising the possibility of a role for receptor editing in shaping the B cell response in some MS patients. The most immediate implications of identifying rearranged Ig sequences in MS B cells is the potential to accurately recreate recombinant Abs from these overrepresented H and L chains that can be used to discover the relevant Ag(s) in MS.},

The large numbers of alleles present at these loci have, however, limited efforts to verify associations between individual alleles and specific diseases. As an approach to reduce allele diversity to hierarchical evolutionarily related groups, we performed phylogenetic analyses of available HLA-A, B and C allele complete sequences (n = 216 alleles) using different approaches (maximum parsimony, distance-based minimum evolution and maximum likelihood). Full nucleotide and amino acid sequences were considered as well as abridged sequences from the hypervariable peptide binding region, known to interact in vivo, with HLA presented foreign peptide. The consensus analyses revealed robust clusters of 36 HLA-C alleles concordant for full and PBR sequence analyses. HLA-A alleles (n = 60) assorted into 12 groups based on full nucleotide and amino acid sequence which with few exceptions recapitulated serological groupings, however the patterns were largely discordant with clusters prescribed by PBR sequences. HLA-B which has the most alleles (n = 120) and which unlike HLA-A and -C is thought to be subject to frequent recombinational exchange, showed limited phylogenetic structure consistent with recent selection driven retention of maximum heterozygosity and population diversity. Those allele categories recognized offer an explicit phylogenetic criterion for grouping alleles potentially relevant for epidemiologic associations, for inferring the origin of MHC genome organization, and for comparing functional constraints in peptide presentation of HLA alleles.},

abstract = {The iPlant Collaborative (iPlant) is a United States National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project that aims to create an innovative, comprehensive, and foundational cyberinfrastructure in support of plant biology research (PSCIC, 2006). iPlant is developing cyberinfrastructure that uniquely enables scientists throughout the diverse fields that comprise plant biology to address Grand Challenges in new ways, to stimulate and facilitate cross-disciplinary research, to promote biology and computer science research interactions, and to train the next generation of scientists on the use of cyberinfrastructure in research and education. Meeting humanity's projected demands for agricultural and forest products and the expectation that natural ecosystems be managed sustainably will require synergies from the application of information technologies. The iPlant cyberinfrastructure design is based on an unprecedented period of research community input, and leverages developments in high-performance computing, data storage, and cyberinfrastructure for the physical sciences. iPlant is an open-source project with application programming interfaces that allow the community to extend the infrastructure to meet its needs. iPlant is sponsoring community-driven workshops addressing specific scientific questions via analysis tool integration and hypothesis testing. These workshops teach researchers how to add bioinformatics tools and/or datasets into the iPlant cyberinfrastructure enabling plant scientists to perform complex analyses on large datasets without the need to master the command-line or high-performance computational services.},

Since its last publication in the NAR webserver issue in 2008, a new generation of peptide:MHC binding and T-cell epitope predictive tools have been added. As validated by different labs and in the first international competition for predicting peptide:MHC-I binding, their predictive performances have improved considerably. In addition, a new B-cell epitope prediction tool was added, and the homology mapping tool was updated to enable mapping of discontinuous epitopes onto 3D structures. Furthermore, to serve a wider range of users, the number of ways in which IEDB-AR can be accessed has been expanded. Specifically, the predictive tools can be programmatically accessed using a web interface and can also be downloaded as software packages.},

abstract = {We have used a single-cell based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification technique to examine the gene expression pattern in single Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (H{\&}RS) cells from seven patients with Hodgkin's disease. Single cells were isolated from lymph nodes obtained at diagnosis (5 of 7 patients) or in first or second relapse (2 of 7 patients). Gene expression was examined by hybridization to a panel of 22 cDNA probes. Forty-nine H{\&}RS cells (and 23 CD3+ or CD20+ lymphocytes as controls) from four patients with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease (HD) and one patient each with lymphocyte predominant and mixed-cellularity HD were successfully analyzed by PCR. This analysis provides evidence that single H{\&}RS cells can coexpress genes characteristic of several hematopoietic lineages (monocytes and lymphocytes). Genes characteristic of activated lymphoid cells are expressed in most H{\&}RS cells. Heterogeneity of expression for certain genes between different cases was found and may eventually define molecular subgroups of HD. These findings indicate that H{\&}RS cells of HD resemble activated hematopoietic cells. Phenotypically similar cells from different cases exhibit characteristic molecular differences. In one patient, 5 of 7 single RS cells showed identical p53 cDNA mutations at codon 246 on specific reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR and sequencing of exons 5 through 8. The novel experimental approach may provide a valuable tool for understanding the molecular events in newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease and progression of the disease.},

HLA-A3 is a predisposing allele for multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The KLIETYFSK peptide is a naturally processed epitope of proteolipid protein, a myelin protein and candidate target for immune-mediated myelin destruction in MS. Comparison of the structure of HLA-A3 with that of HLA-A2, an MHC class I molecule which is protective against MS, indicates that both MHC class I molecules present very similar faces for T-cell receptor recognition whilst differing in the specificity of their peptide-binding grooves. These characteristics may underlie the opposing (predisposing versus protective) associations that they exhibit both in humans and in mouse models of MS-like disease. Furthermore, subtle alterations within the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A3 and other A3-like MHC class I molecules, members of the so-called A3 superfamily, may be sufficient to alter their presentation of autoantigen peptides such as KLIETYFSK. This in turn may modulate their contribution to the associated risk of autoimmune disease.},

This paper is more scattered{\ldots} it's like they were like oh wow we ran out of room on that figure, gotta move on to the next.

Figure 1.
A. Schematic of screen. Introducing "SKM" (yamanaka factors minus Oct4) and oct4 reporter so they could see when oct4 was turned on by a gene in their screen.
B. GATA3 had most significant hit, even though it's not enriched in ESCs and instead is a regulator of developoment and differenentiation. GATA3 could still transform without M but couldn't replace S or K.
C. Evaluated efficiency of transformation when detectable number of colonies that are oct4 positive after some days were present.
D. dpi = days post infection Looks like GATA3 is function mostly at 4-7 dpi?? it's highest 0-10 but then they broke it down to smaller units and then the highest is 4-7
E. Morphology of iPSCs made with G3SKM similar to mouse ESCs (embryoid bodies). Stained for nanog (pluripotency marker) and dapi (nucleus marker). Panel 1: Phase (??) image of primary iPS colony, Panel 2: GFP image of primary iPS colony, Panel 3: GFP of passaged iPS colonies, and expression of nanog in iPSC colonies (passaged or primary?)
F. iPScs in germline --{\&}gt; also get functional baby mice.
(1) Adult chimeric mouse. (2) Phase image of male gonads from iPS chimeric embryo (3) GFP image of male gonads from iPS chimeric embryo 
G. fully iPS mice next to chimeras.
H. Doxycycline-inducble MEFs (can induce G3SKM). Only saw oct4 expression after started detecting oct4-gfp.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNA genes recently found to be abnormally expressed in several types of cancer. Here, we describe a recently developed methodology for miRNA gene expression profiling based on the development of a microchip containing oligonucleotides corresponding to 245 miRNAs from human and mouse genomes. We used these microarrays to obtain highly reproducible results that revealed tissue-specific miRNA expression signatures, data that were confirmed by assessment of expression by Northern blots, real-time RT-PCR, and literature search. The microchip oligolibrary can be expanded to include an increasing number of miRNAs discovered in various species and is useful for the analysis of normal and disease states.},

abstract = {CD19+CD10+ human B lineage bone marrow cells were separated into cycling or resting cells, which differ in their expression of CD34, VpreB, recombination activating gene (RAG-1), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Polymerase chain reaction analyses developed for DHJH and VkJk, VkJkK(de) and VkK(de) rearrangements with DNA of single cells and a comparison with B lineage cell development in mouse bone marrow, allow to delineate the human B lymphocyte pathway of development as follows: CD34+VpreB+RAG-1+TdT+, DHJH-rearranged, kL germline cycling pre-B I cells-->CD34-VpreB+microH chain+ (pre-B receptor+) RAG-1-TdT-, VHDHJH-rearranged, kL germline, cycling pre-B II cells-->CD34-VpreB-, intracytoplasmic microH chain+ (pre-B receptor-) RAG-1+/-TdT-, VHDHJH-rearranged, mainly kL germline cycling pre-B II cells-->CD34-VpreB-intracytoplasmic microH chain+, RAG-1+TdT-, VHDHJH-rearranged, VkJk-rearranged, IgM-, resting pre-B II cells CD34+VpreB-, sIgM+, RAG-1+TdT-, VHDHJH- and VkJk-rearranged IgM+ immature B cells-->CD34-, CD10-, sIgM+/sIgD+ mature B cells. This order, for the first time established for human B lineage cells, shows striking similarities with that established for mouse B lineage cells in bone marrow.},

abstract = {Evolution of eukaryotes is mediated by sexual recombination of parental genomes. Crossovers occur in random, but homologous, positions at a frequency that depends on DNA length. As exons occupy only 1% of the human genome and introns about 24%, by far most of the crossovers occur between exons, rather than inside. The natural process of creating new combinations of exons by intronic recombination is called exon shuffling. Our group is developing in vitro formats for exon shuffling and applying these to the directed evolution of proteins. Based on the splice frame junctions, nine classes of exons and three classes of introns can be distinguished. Splice frame diagrams of natural genes show how the splice frame rules govern exon shuffling. Here, we review various approaches to constructing libraries of exon-shuffled genes. For example, exon shuffling of human pharmaceutical proteins can generate libraries in which all of the sequences are fully human, without the point mutations that raise concerns about immunogenicity.},

This review focuses on the isoform gene regulation, alternative RNA splicing, and posttranslational modifications of troponin subunits in cardiac development and adaptation. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations such as phosphorylation and proteolysis modifications, and structure-function relationships of troponin subunit proteins are summarized. The physiological and pathophysiological significances are discussed for impacts on cardiac muscle contractility, heart function, and adaptations in health and diseases.},

abstract = {Advances in whole genome amplification and next-generation sequencing methods have enabled genomic analyses of single cells, and these techniques are now beginning to be used to detect genomic lesions in individual cancer cells. Previous approaches have been unable to resolve genomic differences in complex mixtures of cells, such as heterogeneous tumors, despite the importance of characterizing such tumors for cancer treatment. Sequencing of single cells is likely to improve several aspects of medicine, including the early detection of rare tumor cells, monitoring of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), measuring intratumor heterogeneity, and guiding chemotherapy. In this review we discuss the challenges and technical aspects of single-cell sequencing, with a strong focus on genomic copy number, and discuss how this information can be used to diagnose and treat cancer patients.},

abstract = {To facilitate gene finding and for the investigation of human molecular genetics on a genome scale, we present a comprehensive survey on various statistical features of human exons. We first show that human exons with flanking genomic DNA sequences can be classified into 12 mutually exclusive categories. This classification could serve as a standard for future studies so that direct comparisons of results can be made. A database for eight categories (related to human genes in which coding regions are split by introns) was built from GenBank release 87.0 and analyzed by a number of methods to characterize statistical features of these sequences that may serve as controls or regulatory signals for gene expression. The statistical information compiled includes profiles of signals for transcription, splicing and translation, various compositional statistics and size distributions. Further analyses reveal novel correlations and constraints among different splicing features across an internal exon that are consistent with the Exon Definition model. This information is fundamental for a quantitative view of human gene organization, and should be invaluable for individual scientists to design human molecular genetics experiments.},

abstract = {Neurons use kinesin and dynein microtubule-dependent motor proteins to transport essential cellular components along axonal and dendritic microtubules. In a search for new kinesin-like proteins, we identified two neuronally enriched mouse kinesins that provide insight into a unique intracellular kinesin targeting mechanism in neurons. KIF21A and KIF21B share colinear amino acid similarity to each other, but not to any previously identified kinesins outside of the motor domain. Each protein also contains a domain of seven WD-40 repeats, which may be involved in binding to cargoes. Despite the amino acid sequence similarity between KIF21A and KIF21B, these proteins localize differently to dendrites and axons. KIF21A protein is localized throughout neurons, while KIF21B protein is highly enriched in dendrites. The plus end-directed motor activity of KIF21B and its enrichment in dendrites indicate that models suggesting that minus end-directed motor activity is sufficient for dendrite specific motor localization are inadequate. We suggest that a novel kinesin sorting mechanism is used by neurons to localize KIF21B protein to dendrites since its mRNA is restricted to the cell body.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the association between carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) and the HLA-B*1502 allele among patients from central China. Eight patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), 28 with mild maculopapular eruptions (MPEs), 50 CBZ-tolerant controls, and 71 healthy volunteers were recruited. HLA genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing (SBT) method. As a result, the HLA-B*1502 allele was observed at the following rates: (1) 100% (8/8) among those with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN, (2) 10.7% (3/28) among those with CBZ-induced MPEs; (3) 8.0% (4/50) among CBZ-tolerant controls; (4) 8.5% (6/71) among healthy volunteers. The eight patients with SJS/TEN positive for the HLA-B*1502 allele had an odds ratio (OR) of 184 compared with CBZ-tolerant controls. There was no significant difference in frequency between patients with MPEs and CBZ-tolerant controls (P>0.05). Thus, CBZ-induced SJS/TEN, but not MPEs, is strongly associated with HLA-B*1502. Testing for HLA-B*1502 should be recommended for patients from central China prior to initial CBZ treatment.},

abstract = {cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) expression is tissue specific and developmentally regulated. Here we report that CREM is unique within the family of cAMP-responsive promoter element (CRE)-binding factors since it is inducible by activation of the cAMP signaling pathway. The kinetic of expression is characteristic of an early response gene. The induction is transient and cell specific, does not involve increased transcript stability, and does not require protein synthesis. Significantly, the subsequent decline in CREM expression requires de novo protein synthesis. The induced transcript encodes a novel repressor, inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), and is generated from an alternative intronic promoter. A cluster of four CREs in this promoter directs cAMP inducibility. ICER binds to these elements and thereby represses the activity of its own promoter, thus constituting a negative autoregulatory loop.},

abstract = {An anticonvulsant, carbamazepine (CBZ), is known to show incidences of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). To identify a gene(s) susceptible to CBZ-induced cADRs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 53 subjects with the CBZ-induced cADRs, including SJS, TEN and DIHS, and 882 subjects of a general population in Japan. Among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed in the GWAS, 12 SNPs showed significant association with CBZ-induced cADRs, and rs1633021 showed the smallest P-value for association with CBZ-induced cADRs (P = 1.18 {\texttimes} 10⁻{\textonesuperior}{\textthreesuperior}). These SNPs were located within a 430 kb linkage disequilibrium block on chromosome 6p21.33, including the HLA-A locus. Thus, we genotyped the individual HLA-A alleles in 61 cases and 376 patients who showed no cADRs by administration of CBZ (CBZ-tolerant controls) and found that HLA-A*3101 was present in 60.7% (37/61) of the patients with CBZ-induced cADRs, but in only 12.5% (47/376) of the CBZ-tolerant controls (odds ratio = 10.8, 95% confidence interval 5.9-19.6, P = 3.64 {\texttimes} 10⁻{\textonesuperior}⁵), implying that this allele has the 60.7% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity when we apply HLA-A*3101 as a risk predictor for CBZ-induced cADRs. Although DIHS is clinically distinguished from SJS and TEN, our data presented here have indicated that they share a common genetic factor as well as a common pathophysiological mechanism. Our findings should provide useful information for making a decision of individualized medication of anticonvulsants.},

abstract = {To assess functional relatedness of individual components of the eukaryotic transcription apparatus, three human subunits (hsRPB5, hsRPB8, and hsRPB10) were tested for their ability to support yeast cell growth in the absence of their essential yeast homologs. Two of the three subunits, hsRPB8 and hsRPB10, supported normal yeast cell growth at moderate temperatures. A fourth human subunit, hsRPB9, is a homolog of the nonessential yeast subunit RPB9. Yeast cells lacking RPB9 are unable to grow at high and low temperatures and are defective in mRNA start site selection. We tested the ability of hsRPB9 to correct the growth and start site selection defect seen in the absence of RPB9. Expression of hsRPB9 on a high-copy-number plasmid, but not a low-copy-number plasmid, restored growth at high temperatures. Recombinant human hsRPB9 was also able to completely correct the start site selection defect seen at the CYC1 promoter in vitro as effectively as the yeast RPB9 subunit. Immunoprecipitation of the cell extracts from yeast cells containing either of the human subunits that function in place of their yeast counterparts in vivo suggested that they assemble with the complete set of yeast RNA polymerase II subunits. Overall, a total of six of the seven human subunits tested previously or in this study are able to substitute for their yeast counterparts in vivo, underscoring the remarkable similarities between the transcriptional machineries of lower and higher eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are encoded by extremely polymorphic genes and play a crucial role in immunity. However, not all genetically different MHC molecules are functionally different. Sette and Sidney (1999) have defined nine HLA class I supertypes and showed that with only nine main functional binding specificities it is possible to cover the binding properties of almost all known HLA class I molecules. Here we present a comprehensive study of the functional relationship between all HLA molecules with known specificities in a uniform and automated way. We have developed a novel method for clustering sequence motifs. We construct hidden Markov models for HLA class I molecules using a Gibbs sampling procedure and use the similarities among these to define clusters of specificities. These clusters are extensions of the previously suggested ones. We suggest splitting some of the alleles in the A1 supertype into a new A26 supertype, and some of the alleles in the B27 supertype into a new B39 supertype. Furthermore the B8 alleles may define their own supertype. We also use the published specificities for a number of HLA-DR types to define clusters with similar specificities. We report that the previously observed specificities of these class II molecules can be clustered into nine classes, which only partly correspond to the serological classification. We show that classification of HLA molecules may be done in a uniform and automated way. The definition of clusters allows for selection of representative HLA molecules that can cover the HLA specificity space better. This makes it possible to target most of the known HLA alleles with known specificities using only a few peptides, and may be used in construction of vaccines. Supplementary material is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/researchgroups/immunology/supertypes.html.},

Current data indicate that pausing is particularly enriched at genes in signal-responsive pathways. Here the evidence for pausing of Pol II from recent high-throughput studies will be discussed, as well as the potential interconnected functions of promoter-proximally paused Pol II.},

Strabismus, which is misalignment of the eyes, affects 2-4% of the population and causes loss of binocular vision and amblyopia (vision loss in a structurally normal eye). The cause of strabismus when it occurs in the absence of structural brain abnormalities is generally unknown. In the last decade, we have focused our research studies on understanding the genetic etiology of a series of complex strabismus syndromes in which eye movement in at least one direction is limited or paralyzed. We are discovering that these disorders result from mutations in genes necessary for the normal development and connectivity of brainstem ocular motoneurons, including PHOX2A, SALL4, KIF21A, ROBO3, and HOXA1, and we now refer to these syndromes as the "congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders," or CCDD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In this paper, we address the problem of identifying and quantifying polymorphisms in RNA-seq data when no reference genome is available, without assembling the full transcripts. Based on the fundamental idea that each polymorphism corresponds to a recognisable pattern in a De Bruijn graph constructed from the RNA-seq reads, we propose a general model for all polymorphisms in such graphs. We then introduce an exact algorithm, called KISSPLICE, to extract alternative splicing events.

RESULTS:We show that KISSPLICE enables to identify more correct events than general purpose transcriptome assemblers. Additionally, on a 71 M reads dataset from human brain and liver tissues, KISSPLICE identified 3497 alternative splicing events, out of which 56% are not present in the annotations, which confirms recent estimates showing that the complexity of alternative splicing has been largely underestimated so far.

CONCLUSIONS:We propose new models and algorithms for the detection of polymorphism in RNA-seq data. This opens the way to a new kind of studies on large HTS RNA-seq datasets, where the focus is not the global reconstruction of full-length transcripts, but local assembly of polymorphic regions. KISSPLICE is available for download at http://alcovna.genouest.org/kissplice/.},

abstract = {Taking advantage of a potent MHC class I-restricted response that allows the identification of antigen- selected CD8 T cells directly ex vivo, we characterized the antigen-specific T cell repertoires that develop in individual mice by single-cell PCR analysis. Each of the immune mice displayed distinct yet structurally similar TCR repertoires. The overall repertoire size was estimated to be in the range of 15-20 for most mice. No major differences were observed between primary and secondary responses. Moreover, for a hyperimmunized mouse the antigen-specific TCR repertoire expressed 8 months after the initial immunization was very similar to that found at the peak of the primary response. Our results demonstrate that a high magnitude immune response may be composed of very few clones, and that at least in the system analyzed, the memory response largely reflects the repertoire selected by the peak of the primary response.},

abstract = {Post-transcriptional mechanisms play critical roles in the control of gene expression during neuronal development and maturation as they allow for faster responses to environmental cues and provide spatially-restricted compartments for local control of protein expression. These mechanisms depend on the interaction of cis-acting elements present in the mRNA sequence and trans-acting factors, such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that bind to those cis-elements and regulate mRNA stability, subcellular localization, and translation. Recent studies have uncovered an unexpected complexity in these interactions, where coding and non-coding RNAs, termed competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), compete for binding to miRNAs. This competition can, thereby, control a larger number of miRNA target transcripts. However, competing RNA networks also extend to competition between target mRNAs for binding to limited amounts of RBPs. In this review, we present evidence that competitions between target mRNAs for binding to RBPs also occur in neurons, where they affect transcript stability and transport into axons and dendrites as well as translation. In addition, we illustrate the complexity of these mechanisms by demonstrating that RBPs and miRNAs also compete for target binding and regulation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene regulatory dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating these interactions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing the observed changes in gene expression. To perform this integration systematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening a molecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e., connected regions of the network that show significant changes in expression over particular subsets of conditions. The method we present here combines a rigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm for identifying subnetworks with high score. RESULTS: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public databases. In the case of the small network, we identified five significant subnetworks that covered 41 out of 77 (53%) of all significant changes in expression. Both network analyses returned several top-scoring subnetworks with good correspondence to known regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These results demonstrate how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to uncover signalling and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative fashion.},

abstract = {Less than 3% of the human genome generates protein-coding transcripts; the majority, far from being strewn with evolutionary "junk," is dynamically transcribed into non(protein)-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These ncRNAs provide another provide another, previously hidden, level of regulatory information that appears to be involved in hard- and soft-wired epigentic processes. The extensive and intricate level of gene regulation provided by ncRNAs may be the major driver for the accelerated development of the human brain and its associated increase in complexity and cognition. Support for this is provided by the correlation between the evolutionary increase of complexity in the nonprotein-coding transcriptome paralleling cognitive evolution in primates, in contrast to the coincidently modest evolutionary changes of the protein-coding transcriptome. The essential role of these regulatory RNAs is reflected in almost every aspect in neuroscience, including chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, RNA editing and translation. Dissecting this plethora of regulatory networks and editing events, which are orchestrated through long and small noncoding RNAs, and their interaction with transcription factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and other protein effectors will provide essential insights into the transcriptional complexity and plasticity in the development and function of the human brain. Such complexity provides susceptibility to internal and external perturbations, which in rare cases might act as evolutionary catalysts, but in many cases could manifest as neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases. NcRNAs (especially lncRNAs) are therefore excellent candidates for both disease biomarkers and disease-ameliorating therapies.},

abstract = {Malaria parasites undergo a sporogonic cycle in the mosquito vector. Sporozoites, the form of the parasite injected into the host during a bloodmeal, develop inside oocysts in the insect midgut, then migrate to and eventually invade the salivary glands. The circumsporozoite protein (CS), one of the major proteins synthesized by salivary gland sporozoites, is a surface-associated molecule which is important in sporozoite infectivity to the host. Here, by gene targeting, we created Plasmodium berghei lines in which the single-copy CS gene was disrupted. The CS(-) and wild-type parasites produced similar numbers of oocysts of comparable size in the mosquito midgut. In the CS(-) oocysts, however, sporozoite formation was profoundly inhibited. CS therefore appears to have a pleiotropic role and to be vital for malaria parasites in both the vector and the host: in mosquitoes, CS is essential for sporozoite development within oocysts, and in the vertebrate host it promotes sporozoite attachment to hepatocytes.},

The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is an open investigation of reproducibility in preclinical cancer biology research. We have identified 50 high impact cancer biology articles published in the period 2010-2012, and plan to replicate a subset of experimental results from each article. A Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for each subset of experiments will be peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The results of these experiments will then be published in a Replication Study. The resulting open methodology and dataset will provide evidence about the reproducibility of high-impact results, and an opportunity to identify predictors of reproducibility.},

abstract = {Inosine is an abundant RNA modification in the human transcriptome and is essential for many biological processes in modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosines to inosines (A-to-I editing) in double-stranded regions. We previously established a biochemical method called "inosine chemical erasing" (ICE) to directly identify inosines on RNA strands with high reliability. Here, we have applied the ICE method combined with deep sequencing (ICE-seq) to conduct an unbiased genome-wide screening of A-to-I editing sites in the transcriptome of human adult brain. Taken together with the sites identified by the conventional ICE method, we mapped 19,791 novel sites and newly found 1258 edited mRNAs, including 66 novel sites in coding regions, 41 of which cause altered amino acid assignment. ICE-seq detected novel editing sites in various repeat elements as well as in short hairpins.

Figure 1.
A. Took female ESCs that had transgenes of Prdm1-mVenus and Dppa3-ECFP and induced them in to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), then primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), then co-cultured them with embryonic gonadl somatic cells to create reconstituted ovaries, which are then transplaned into mice ovaries or kidney capsules.
B. y-axis, log-CT value. Red, different stages of EpiLC, PGCLC production. Green, Embryonic day 12.5 gonads. Blue, day6 in their protocol. They're arguing that their protocol creates cells that look like ovaries. Compared to if they didn't co-culture as in d6 (day 6 PGCLC)
C. Hierarchical clustering of E12.5 PGCs, showing that the co-cultured cells look more like actual gonads than the day6 cells.
D. Top, showing that the localization of SYCP3 (synaptonemal complex protein 3, blue, component of meiotic homologous chromosomes) in d3ag9 PGCLCs is similar to that of the E15.15 PGCs. Also showing DDX4 (Dead box polypeptide 4, cytoplasmic RNA helicase expressed in germ cells).
Middle, Blimp1-mVenus and stella-ECFP reporter (yay negative control)
Bottom, DAPI staining

A. (i) Added PGCLCs to ovarian bursa of nude mice (2 reconstituted ovaries per recipent ovary), then 4 weeks and 4 days later, saw vascularization and growth of the ovary. 
A. (ii) Fluorescent view, seeing the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in the complex.
B. IVM = in vitro maturation, IVF = in vitro fertilization.
Performed IVM on the PGC-derived oocytes and WT oocytes at three weeks. Then at Metaphase II (MII), the oocytes were fertilized, then develop into two-cell embryos at similar efficiency.

abstract = {The heterogeneity of neural gene expression and the spatially limited expression of many low-abundance messenger RNAs in the brain has made cloning and analysis of such messages difficult. To generate amounts of nucleic acids sufficient for use in standard cloning strategies, we have devised a method for producing amplified heterogeneous populations of RNA from limited quantities of cDNA. Whole cerebellar RNA was primed with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence 5' to a polythymidylate region. After second-strand cDNA synthesis, T7 RNA polymerase was used to generate amplified antisense RNA (aRNA). Up to 80-fold molar amplification has been achieved from nanogram quantities of cDNA. The amplified material is similar in size distribution to the parent cDNA and shows sequence heterogeneity as assessed by Southern and Northern blot analysis. Specific messages for moderate-abundance mRNAs for actin and guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) alpha subunits have been detected in the amplified material. By using in situ transcription to generate cDNA, sequences for cyclophilin have been detected in aRNA derived from single cerebellar tissue sections. cDNA derived from a single cerebellar Purkinje cell also has been amplified and yields material that hybridizes to cognate whole RNA and mRNA but not to Escherichia coli RNA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Sequence specific RNA binding proteins are important regulators of gene expression. Several related crosslinking-based, high-throughput sequencing methods, including PAR-CLIP, have recently been developed to determine direct binding sites of global protein-RNA interactions. However, no studies have quantitatively addressed the contribution of background binding to datasets produced by these methods.

RESULTS:We measured non-specific RNA background in PAR-CLIP data, demonstrating that covalently crosslinked background binding is common, reproducible and apparently universal among laboratories. We show that quantitative determination of background is essential for identifying targets of most RNA-binding proteins and can substantially improve motif analysis. We also demonstrate that by applying background correction to an RNA binding protein of unknown binding specificity, Caprin1, we can identify a previously unrecognized RNA recognition element not otherwise apparent in a PAR-CLIP study.

CONCLUSIONS:Empirical background measurements of global RNA-protein crosslinking are a necessary addendum to other experimental controls, such as performing replicates, because covalently crosslinked background signals are reproducible and otherwise unavoidable. Recognizing and quantifying the contribution of background extends the utility of PAR-CLIP and can improve mechanistic understanding of protein-RNA specificity, protein-RNA affinity and protein-RNA association dynamics.},

abstract = {The splicing of nuclear pre-mRNAs is a fundamental process required for the expression of most metazoan genes. The majority of the approximately 25,000 genes encoded by the human genome has been shown to produce more than one kind of transcripts through alternative splicing. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs can lead to the production of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene, significantly enriching the proteomic diversity of higher eukaryotic organisms. Because regulation of this process determines the timing and location that a particular protein isoform is produced, changes of alternative splicing patterns have the potential to modulate many cellular activities. Consequently, pre-mRNA splicing must occur with a high degree of specificity and fidelity to ensure the appropriate expression of functional mRNAs. Here we review recent progress made in understanding the extent of alternative splicing within the human genome with particular emphasis on splicing fidelity.},

We recommend approximating short sequence motif distributions with the maximum entropy distribution (MED) consistent with low-order marginal constraints estimated from available data, which may include dependencies between nonadjacent as well as adjacent positions. Many maximum entropy models (MEMs) are specified by simply changing the set of constraints. Such models can be utilized to discriminate between signals and decoys. Classification performance using different MEMs gives insight into the relative importance of dependencies between different positions. We apply our framework to large datasets of RNA splicing signals. Our best models out-perform previous probabilistic models in the discrimination of human 5' (donor) and 3' (acceptor) splice sites from decoys. Finally, we discuss mechanistically motivated ways of comparing models.},

abstract = {Self-renewing embryonic stem (ES) cells have been established from early mouse embryos as permanent cell lines. By cultivation in vitro as three-dimensional aggregates called embryoid bodies (EBs), ES cells can differentiate into derivatives of all three primary germ layers, including cardiomyocytes. ES cells thus represent a useful model system for studying cardiomyocyte developmental paradigms. This chapter describes techniques and protocols for the cultivation and maintenance of ES cell lines, and the differentiation of ES cell lines into all specialized cell types of the heart, including atrial-, ventricular-, sinus nodal- and Purkinje-like cardiomyocytes. We also include protocols for the isolation and evaluation (morphological, molecular, and functional) of in vitro-generated cardiomyocytes. We consider these latter techniques to be prerequisites for the successful use of this model system to study cardiomyocyte differentiation. Finally, our objective in writing this chapter is to provide sufficient detail and explanation so that any competent scientist who is new to the field will be able to successfully establish and employ this model system for the analysis of ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.

RESULTS:We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.

CONCLUSIONS:MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs. MUSCLE is freely available at http://www.drive5.com/muscle.},

abstract = {Dimension reduction is a key algorithmic tool with many applications including nearest-neighbor search, compressed sensing and linear algebra in the streaming model. In this work we obtain a {\em sparse} version of the fundamental tool in dimension reduction --- the Johnson--Lindenstrauss transform. Using hashing and local densification, we construct a sparse projection matrix with just $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ non-zero entries per column. We also show a matching lower bound on the sparsity for a large class of projection matrices. Our bounds are somewhat surprising, given the known lower bounds of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ both on the number of rows of any projection matrix and on the sparsity of projection matrices generated by natural constructions. Using this, we achieve an $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ update time per non-zero element for a $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximate projection, thereby substantially outperforming the $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ update time required by prior approaches. A variant of our method offers the same guarantees for sparse vectors, yet its $\tilde{O}(d)$ worst case running time matches the best approach of Ailon and Liberty.},

abstract = {Regulation of tau exon 10 splicing plays an important role in tauopathy. One of the cis elements regulating tau alternative splicing is a stem-loop structure at the 5' splice site of tau exon 10. The RNA helicase(s) modulating this stem-loop structure was unknown. We searched for splicing regulators interacting with this stem-loop region using an RNA affinity pulldown-coupled mass spectrometry approach and identified DDX5/RNA helicase p68 as an activator of tau exon 10 splicing. The activity of p68 in stimulating tau exon 10 inclusion is dependent on RBM4, an intronic splicing activator. RNase H cleavage and U1 protection assays suggest that p68 promotes conformational change of the stem-loop structure, thereby increasing the access of U1snRNP to the 5' splice site of tau exon 10. This study reports the first RNA helicase interacting with a stem-loop structure at the splice site and regulating alternative splicing in a helicase-dependent manner. Our work uncovers a previously unknown function of p68 in regulating tau exon 10 splicing. Furthermore, our experiments reveal functional interaction between two splicing activators for tau exon 10, p68 binding at the stem-loop region and RBM4 interacting with the intronic splicing enhancer region.},

Molecular combing was observed to extend the length of the bacteriophage lambda DNA molecule to 21.5 +/- 0.5 micrometers (unextended length, 16.2 micrometers). With the combing process, it was possible to (i) extend a chromosomal Escherichia coli DNA fragment (10(6) base pairs) and (ii) detect a minute quantity of DNA (10(3) molecules). These results open the way for a faster physical mapping of the genome and for the detection of small quantities of target DNA from a population of molecules.},

abstract = {Multicellular systems develop from single cells through distinct lineages. However, current lineage-tracing approaches scale poorly to whole, complex organisms. Here, we use genome editing to progressively introduce and accumulate diverse mutations in a DNA barcode over multiple rounds of cell division. The barcode, an array of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 target sites, marks cells and enables the elucidation of lineage relationships via the patterns of mutations shared between cells. In cell culture and zebrafish, we show that rates and patterns of editing are tunable and that thousands of lineage-informative barcode alleles can be generated. By sampling hundreds of thousands of cells from individual zebrafish, we find that most cells in adult organs derive from relatively few embryonic progenitors. In future analyses, genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing (GESTALT) can be used to generate large-scale maps of cell lineage in multicellular systems for normal development and disease.},

abstract = {We have developed a method to target gene expression in the Drosophila embryo to a specific cell without having a promoter that directs expression in that particular cell. Using a digitally enhanced imaging system to identify single cells within the living embryo, we apply a heat shock to each cell individually by using a laser microbeam. A 1- to 2-min laser treatment is sufficient to induce a heat-shock response but is not lethal to the heat-shocked cells. Induction of heat shock was measured in a variety of cell types, including neurons and somatic muscles, by the expression of beta-galactosidase from an hsp26-lacZ reporter construct or by expression of a UAS target gene after induction of hsGAL4. We discuss the applicability of this technique to ectopic gene expression studies, lineage tracing, gene inactivation studies, and studies of cells in vitro. Laser heat shock is a versatile technique that can be adapted for use in a variety of research organisms and is useful for any studies in which it is desirable to express a given gene in only a distinct cell or clone of cells, either transiently or constitutively, at a time point of choice.},

HMGB1 can also be secreted by activated monocytes and macrophages, and functions as a late mediator of inflammation. Secretion of a nuclear protein requires a tightly controlled relocation program. We show here that in all cells HMGB1 shuttles actively between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Monocytes and macrophages acetylate HMGB1 extensively upon activation with lipopolysaccharide; moreover, forced hyperacetylation of HMGB1 in resting macrophages causes its relocalization to the cytosol. Cytosolic HMGB1 is then concentrated by default into secretory lysosomes, and secreted when monocytic cells receive an appropriate second signal.},

abstract = {Homologous recombination by the E. coli RecBC pathway occurs at elevated frequency near Chi sites. We reported previously that Chi induces RecBC enzyme to cleave one DNA strand--that containing the Chi sequence 5'G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G3'. We report here that the Chi-dependent cleavage occurs four, five, or six nucleotides to the 3' side of the Chi octamer and produces nicks with 3'-OH and 5'-PO4 groups. Chi-dependent cleavage occurs if RecBC enzyme approaches the Chi sequence from the right, but not if it approaches only from the left, during unwinding of the duplex DNA substrate. A single RecBC enzyme molecule appears to cleave the DNA and to release part of it as a single-stranded fragment. These and previous results indicate that Chi-dependent cleavage is concomitant with DNA unwinding by RecBC enzyme and provide an enzymatic basis for the orientation-dependence of Chi recombinational hotspot activity. These observations demonstrate a key step of a proposed model of recombination in which RecBC enzyme produces a potentially invasive single-stranded DNA tail extending from Chi to its left. We discuss the relation between the action of Chi sites and that of special sites enhancing eukaryotic recombination.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by mutations in a number of genes, including the gene encoding the RNA/DNA-binding protein translocated in liposarcoma or fused in sarcoma (TLS/FUS or FUS). Previously, we identified a number of FUS target genes, among them MECP2. To investigate how ALS mutations in FUS might impact target gene expression, we examined the effects of several FUS derivatives harboring ALS mutations, such as R521C (FUS(C)), on MECP2 expression in transfected human U87 cells. Strikingly, FUS(C) and other mutants not only altered MECP2 alternative splicing but also markedly increased mRNA abundance, which we show resulted from sharply elevated stability. Paradoxically, however, MeCP2 protein levels were significantly reduced in cells expressing ALS mutant derivatives. Providing a parsimonious explanation for these results, biochemical fractionation and in vivo localization studies revealed that MECP2 mRNA colocalized with cytoplasmic FUS(C) in insoluble aggregates, which are characteristic of ALS mutant proteins. Together, our results establish that ALS mutations in FUS can strongly impact target gene expression, reflecting a dominant effect of FUS-containing aggregates.},

abstract = {We present a concept and formalism, the string graph, which represents all that is inferable about a DNA sequence from a collection of shotgun sequencing reads collected from it. We give time and space efficient algorithms for constructing a string graph given the collection of overlaps between the reads and, in particular, present a novel linear expected time algorithm for transitive reduction in this context. The result demonstrates that the decomposition of reads into kmers employed in the de Bruijn graph approach described earlier is not essential, and exposes its close connection to the unitig approach we developed at Celera. This paper is a preliminary piece giving the basic algorithm and results that demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the method. These ideas are being used to build a next-generation whole genome assembler called BOA (Berkeley Open Assembler) that will easily scale to mammalian genomes.},

As proof of principle, we used the approach to compare fluorouracil-resistant and -nonresistant human colorectal cancer cell lines. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the approach by comparison to exon tiling and splicing microarrays and validated the results with reverse transcription-PCR, quantitative PCR and Sanger sequencing. We observed global disruption of splicing in fluorouracil-resistant cells characterized by expression of new mRNA isoforms resulting from exon skipping, alternative splice site usage and intron retention. Alternative expression annotation databases, source code, a data viewer and other resources to facilitate analysis are available at http://www.alexaplatform.org/alexa_seq/.},

abstract = {Fit-1 has been identified previously as a Fos-responsive gene of rat fibroblasts. Here we show that Fit-1 is directly regulated by the estrogen-inducible transcription factor Fos-ER and that it belongs to the family of delayed early genes. Two different mRNA isoforms are expressed from the Fit-1 gene. The Fit-1M mRNA isolated from spleen codes for a membrane-bound protein which is most closely related in its extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains to the type I interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor. The Fit-1S mRNA of fibroblasts directs, instead, the synthesis of a secreted protein consisting of only the extracellular domain. Analysis of the exon-intron structure of the Fit-1 gene indicated that the Fit-1S and Fit-1M mRNAs are transcribed from two different promoters and that the sequence differences at their 3' ends result from alternative 3' processing. Northern blot analysis with specific 5' and 3' probes directly demonstrated tight coupling between alternative promoter usage and 3' processing of the Fit-1 transcripts. The orthologous gene of the mouse (known as T1 or ST2) is expressed during ontogeny first in the fetal liver of the embryo and then in lung and hematopoietic tissues of the adult. The mRNA coding for the membrane-bound protein is more abundantly expressed in all of these tissues, while the transcript for the secreted form predominates in fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells. Differential regulation of two distinct promoters is thus used to determine the ratio between secreted and membrane-bound forms of Fit-1 (T1/ST2) which may modulate signaling in response to IL-1.},

Given a discrete clustering formulation, we first solve a relaxed continuous optimization problem by eigen-decomposition. We clarify the role of eigenvectors as a generator of all optimal solutions through orthonormal transforms. We then solve an optimal discretization problem, which seeks a discrete solution closest to the continuous optima. The discretization is efficiently computed in an iterative fashion using singular value decomposition and nonmaximum suppression. The resulting discrete solutions are nearly global-optimal. Our method is robust to random initialization and converges faster than other clustering methods. Experiments on real image segmentation are reported. View full abstract},

abstract = {We present algorithms for time-series gene expression analysis that permit the principled estimation of unobserved time points, clustering, and dataset alignment. Each expression profile is modeled as a cubic spline (piecewise polynomial) that is estimated from the observed data and every time point influences the overall smooth expression curve. We constrain the spline coefficients of genes in the same class to have similar expression patterns, while also allowing for gene specific parameters. We show that unobserved time points can be reconstructed using our method with 10-15% less error when compared to previous best methods. Our clustering algorithm operates directly on the continuous representations of gene expression profiles, and we demonstrate that this is particularly effective when applied to nonuniformly sampled data. Our continuous alignment algorithm also avoids difficulties encountered by discrete approaches. In particular, our method allows for control of the number of degrees of freedom of the warp through the specification of parameterized functions, which helps to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate that our algorithm produces stable low-error alignments on real expression data and further show a specific application to yeast knock-out data that produces biologically meaningful results.},

abstract = {Most mammalian genes produce multiple distinct messenger RNAs through alternative splicing, but the extent of splicing conservation is not clear. To assess tissue-specific transcriptome variation across mammals, we sequenced complementary DNA from nine tissues from four mammals and one bird in biological triplicate, at unprecedented depth. We find that while tissue-specific gene expression programs are largely conserved, alternative splicing is well conserved in only a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. Thousands of previously unknown, lineage-specific, and conserved alternative exons were identified; widely conserved alternative exons had signatures of binding by MBNL, PTB, RBFOX, STAR, and TIA family splicing factors, implicating them as ancestral mammalian splicing regulators. Our data also indicate that alternative splicing often alters protein phosphorylatability, delimiting the scope of kinase signaling.},

abstract = {One of the most important, but often ignored, parts of any clustering and classification algorithm is the computation of the similarity matrix. This is especially important when integrating high throughput biological data sources because of the high noise rates and the many missing values. In this paper we present a new method to compute such similarities for the task of classifying pairs of proteins as interacting or not. Our method uses direct and indirect information about interaction pairs to constructs a random forest (a collection of decision tress) from a training set. The resulting forest is used to determine the similarity between protein pairs and this similarity is used by a classification algorithm (a modified kNN) to classify protein pairs. Testing the algorithm on yeast data indicates that it is able to improve coverage to 20% of interacting pairs with a false positive rate of 50%. These results compare favorably with all previously suggested methods for this task indicating the importance of robust similarity estimates.},

abstract = {ADR1 and CAT8 encode carbon source-responsive transcriptional regulators that cooperatively control expression of genes involved in ethanol utilization. These transcription factors are active only after the diauxic transition, when glucose is depleted and energy-generating metabolism has shifted to the aerobic oxidation of non-fermentable carbon sources. The Snf1 protein kinase complex is required for activation of their downstream target genes described previously. Using DNA microarrays, we determined the extent to which these three factors collaborate in regulating the expression of the yeast genome after glucose depletion. The expression of 108 genes is significantly decreased in the absence of ADR1. The importance of ADR1 during the diauxic transition is illustrated by the observation that expression of almost one-half of the 40 most highly glucose-repressed genes is ADR1-dependent. ADR1-dependent genes fall into a variety of functional classes with carbon metabolism containing the largest number of members. Most of the genes in this class are involved in the oxidation of different non-fermentable carbon sources. These microarray data show that ADR1 coordinates the biochemical pathways that generate acetyl-CoA and NADH from non-fermentable substrates. Only a small number of ADR1-dependent genes are also CAT8-dependent. However, nearly one-half of the ADR1-dependent genes are also dependent on the Snf1 protein kinase for derepression. Many more genes are SNF1-dependent than are either ADR1- or CAT8-dependent suggesting that SNF1 plays a broader role in gene expression than either ADR1 or CAT8. The largest class of SNF1-dependent genes encodes regulatory proteins that could extend SNF1 dependence to additional pathways.},

abstract = {SR proteins are well-characterized RNA binding proteins that promote exon inclusion by binding to exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). However, it has been unclear whether regulatory rules deduced on model genes apply generally to activities of SR proteins in the cell. Here, we report global analyses of two prototypical SR proteins, SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) and SRSF2 (SC35), using splicing-sensitive arrays and CLIP-seq on mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Unexpectedly, we find that these SR proteins promote both inclusion and skipping of exons in~vivo, but their binding patterns do not explain such opposite responses. Further analyses reveal that loss of one SR protein is accompanied by coordinated loss or compensatory gain in the interaction of other SR proteins at the affected exons. Therefore, specific effects on regulated splicing by one SR protein actually depend on a complex set of relationships with multiple other SR proteins in mammalian genomes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Alternative splicing is known to increase the complexity of mammalian transcriptomes since nearly all mammalian genes express multiple pre-mRNA isoforms. However, our knowledge of the extent and function of alternative splicing in early embryonic development is based mainly on a few isolated examples. High throughput technologies now allow us to study genome-wide alternative splicing during mouse development.

RESULTS:A genome-wide analysis of alternative isoform expression in embryonic day 8.5, 9.5 and 11.5 mouse embryos and placenta was carried out using a splicing-sensitive exon microarray. We show that alternative splicing and isoform expression is frequent across developmental stages and tissues, and is comparable in frequency to the variation in whole-transcript expression. The genes that are alternatively spliced across our samples are disproportionately involved in important developmental processes. Finally, we find that a number of RNA binding proteins, including putative splicing factors, are differentially expressed and spliced across our samples suggesting that such proteins may be involved in regulating tissue and temporal variation in isoform expression. Using an example of a well characterized splicing factor, Fox2, we demonstrate that changes in Fox2 expression levels can be used to predict changes in inclusion levels of alternative exons that are flanked by Fox2 binding sites.

CONCLUSIONS:We propose that alternative splicing is an important developmental regulatory mechanism. We further propose that gene expression should routinely be monitored at both the whole transcript and the isoform level in developmental studies.},

Here, we show how these arrays enable efficient implementation of numerical computations in a high-level language. Overall, three techniques are applied to improve performance: vectorizing calculations, avoiding copying data in memory, and minimizing operation counts. We first present the NumPy array structure, then show how to use it for efficient computation, and finally how to share array data with other libraries.

abstract = {Promoters have been defined as modulatory DNA structures containing a complex array of cis-acting regulatory elements required for accurate and efficient initiation of transcription and for controlling expression of a gene. It is becoming increasingly evident that they also constitute prime target elements through which diversity and flexibility in the complex patterns of gene expression in multicellular organisms are created. The use of multiple promoters and transcription start sites is apparently a frequently used mechanism, whereas at the same time there is considerable variation and complexity in the patterns of alternative promoter usage. This review discusses the use of alternative promoters as a versatile mechanism to create diversity and flexibility in the regulation of gene expression. Alternative promoter usage can influence gene expression in very diverse ways. The level of transcription initiation can vary between alternative promoters, the turnover or translation efficiency of mRNA isoforms with different leader exons can differ, alternative promoters can have different tissue specificity and react differently to some signals, and finally, alternative promoter usage can lead to the generation of protein isoforms differing at the amino terminus.},

The majority of these appear to be nonessential genes (i.e., are not embryonically lethal when inactivated), and one could therefore speculate that they are late additions in the evolutionary lineage toward humans. Contrary to this expectation, we find that they are in fact significantly overrepresented among the genes that have emerged during the early evolution of the metazoa. Using a phylostratigraphic approach, we have studied the evolutionary emergence of such genes at 19 phylogenetic levels. The majority of disease genes was already present in the eukaryotic ancestor, and the second largest number has arisen around the time of evolution of multicellularity. Conversely, genes specific to the mammalian lineage are highly underrepresented. Hence, genes involved in genetic diseases are not simply a random subset of all genes in the genome but are biased toward ancient genes.},

abstract = {Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has revolutionised our understanding of transcriptome variability, with profound implications both fundamental and translational. While scRNA-seq provides a comprehensive measurement of stochasticity in transcription, the limitations of the technology have prevented its application to dissect variability in RNA processing events such as splicing. Here we present BRIE (Bayesian Regression for Isoform Estimation), a Bayesian hierarchical model which resolves these problems by learning an informative prior distribution from multiple single cells. BRIE combines the mixture modelling approach for isoform quantification with a regression approach to learn sequence features which are predictive of splicing events. We validate BRIE on several scRNA-seq data sets, showing that BRIE yields reproducible estimates of exon inclusion ratios in single cells and provides an effective tool for differential isoform quantification between scRNA-seq data sets. BRIE therefore expands the scope of scRNA-seq experiments to probe the stochasticity of RNA-processing.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:Previous studies found a strong association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in Han Chinese, but not in Caucasian populations. Even in Han Chinese, the HLA-B*1502 was not associated with CBZ-induced maculopapular eruptions (MPE). This study seeks to identify whether HLA-B*1502 is associated with CBZ- or phenytoin (PHT)-induced SJS or MPE in a Thai population.

METHODS:Eighty-one Thai epileptic patients between 1994 and 2007 from the Chulalongkorn Comprehensive Epilepsy Program were recruited. Thirty-one subjects had antiepileptic drug (AED)-induced SJS or MPE (6 CBZ-SJS, 4 PHT-SJS, 9 CBZ-MPE, 12 PHT-MPE), and 50 were AED-tolerant controls.

RESULTS:For the first time, a strong association between HLA-B*1502 and PHT-induced SJS was found (p = 0.005). A strong association was also found between the HLA-B*1502 and CBZ-induced SJS (p = 0.0005), making Thai the first non-Chinese population demonstrating such an association. Some patients, who were HLA-B*1502 and suffered from CBZ-induced SJS, could be tolerant to PHT and vice versa. This suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a common attribute required for a Thai patient to develop SJS from these two AEDs; other different elements, however, are also needed for each AED. In addition, no association between HLA-B alleles and CBZ- or PHT-induced MPE was found.

CONCLUSIONS:CBZ- and PHT-induced SJS, but not MPE, is associated with HLA-B*1502 allele in Thai population.},

abstract = {Skipping stones across water has been a popular pastime for thousands of years - the rules of the game have remained unchanged since the time of the ancient Greeks - and the world record, set by J. Coleman-McGhee in 1992, is believed to be 38 rebounds. Following earlier attempts to analyse the physics of this ancestral human activity, we focus here on the crucial moment in stone skipping: when the stone bounces on the water's surface. By monitoring the collision of a spinning disc with water, we have discovered that an angle of about 20 degrees between the stone and the water's surface is optimal with respect to the throwing conditions and yields the maximum possible number of bounces.},

To map the transcriptional network controlling the damage response, we measured genomewide binding locations for 30 damage-related transcription factors (TFs) after exposure of yeast to methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS). The resulting 5272 TF-target interactions revealed extensive changes in the pattern of promoter binding and identified damage-specific binding motifs. As systematic functional validation, we identified interactions for which the target changed expression in wild-type cells in response to MMS but was nonresponsive in cells lacking the TF. Validated interactions were assembled into causal pathway models that provide global hypotheses of how signaling, transcription, and phenotype are integrated after damage.},

abstract = {The pattern of residue substitution in divergently evolving families of globular proteins is highly variable. At each position in a fold there are constraints on the identities of amino acids from both the three-dimensional structure and the function of the protein. To characterize and quantify the structural constraints, we have made a comparative analysis of families of homologous globular proteins. Residues are classified according to amino acid type, secondary structure, accessibility of the sidechain, and existence of hydrogen bonds from sidechain to other sidechains or peptide carbonyl or amide functions. There are distinct patterns of substitution especially where residues are both solvent inaccessible and hydrogen bonded through their sidechains. The patterns of residue substitution can be used to construct templates or to identify 'key' residues if one or more structures are known. Conversely, analysis of conversation and substitution across a large family of aligned sequences in terms of substitution profiles can allow prediction of tertiary environment or indicate a functional role. Similar analyses can be used to test the validity of putative structures if several homologous sequences are available.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:MicroRNA expression profiles can be used to distinguish normal B cells from malignant B cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We investigated whether microRNA profiles are associated with known prognostic factors in CLL.

METHODS:We evaluated the microRNA expression profiles of 94 samples of CLL cells for which the level of expression of 70-kD zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), the mutational status of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IgV(H) ) gene, and the time from diagnosis to initial treatment were known. We also investigated the genomic sequence of 42 microRNA genes to identify abnormalities.

RESULTS:A unique microRNA expression signature composed of 13 genes (of 190 analyzed) differentiated cases of CLL with low levels of ZAP-70 expression from those with high levels and cases with unmutated IgV(H) from those with mutated IgV(H) . The same microRNA signature was also associated with the presence or absence of disease progression. We also identified a germ-line mutation in the miR-16-1-miR-15a primary precursor, which caused low levels of microRNA expression in vitro and in vivo and was associated with deletion of the normal allele. Germ-line or somatic mutations were found in 5 of 42 sequenced microRNAs in 11 of 75 patients with CLL, but no such mutations were found in 160 subjects without cancer (P<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS:A unique microRNA signature is associated with prognostic factors and disease progression in CLL. Mutations in microRNA transcripts are common and may have functional importance.},

abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) exert a broad range of biological functions. To explore the scope of RBPs across eukaryotic evolution, we determined the in vivo RBP repertoire of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified 678 RBPs from yeast and additionally 729 RBPs from human hepatocytic HuH-7 cells. Combined analyses of these and recently published data sets define the core RBP repertoire conserved from yeast to man. Conserved RBPs harbour defined repetitive motifs within disordered regions, which display striking evolutionary expansion. Only 60% of yeast and 73% of the human RBPs have functions assigned to RNA biology or structural motifs known to convey RNA binding, and many intensively studied proteins surprisingly emerge as RBPs (termed 'enigmRBPs'), including almost all glycolytic enzymes, pointing to emerging connections between gene regulation and metabolism. Analyses of the mitochondrial hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B10) uncover the RNA-binding specificity of an enigmRBP.},

abstract = {Less than 3% of the human genome generates protein-coding transcripts; the majority, far from being strewn with evolutionary "junk," is dynamically transcribed into non(protein)-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These ncRNAs provide another provide another, previously hidden, level of regulatory information that appears to be involved in hard- and soft-wired epigentic processes. The extensive and intricate level of gene regulation provided by ncRNAs may be the major driver for the accelerated development of the human brain and its associated increase in complexity and cognition. Support for this is provided by the correlation between the evolutionary increase of complexity in the nonprotein-coding transcriptome paralleling cognitive evolution in primates, in contrast to the coincidently modest evolutionary changes of the protein-coding transcriptome. The essential role of these regulatory RNAs is reflected in almost every aspect in neuroscience, including chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, RNA editing and translation. Dissecting this plethora of regulatory networks and editing events, which are orchestrated through long and small noncoding RNAs, and their interaction with transcription factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and other protein effectors will provide essential insights into the transcriptional complexity and plasticity in the development and function of the human brain. Such complexity provides susceptibility to internal and external perturbations, which in rare cases might act as evolutionary catalysts, but in many cases could manifest as neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases. NcRNAs (especially lncRNAs) are therefore excellent candidates for both disease biomarkers and disease-ameliorating therapies.},

abstract = {Inosine is an abundant RNA modification in the human transcriptome and is essential for many biological processes in modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosines to inosines (A-to-I editing) in double-stranded regions. We previously established a biochemical method called "inosine chemical erasing" (ICE) to directly identify inosines on RNA strands with high reliability. Here, we have applied the ICE method combined with deep sequencing (ICE-seq) to conduct an unbiased genome-wide screening of A-to-I editing sites in the transcriptome of human adult brain. Taken together with the sites identified by the conventional ICE method, we mapped 19,791 novel sites and newly found 1258 edited mRNAs, including 66 novel sites in coding regions, 41 of which cause altered amino acid assignment. ICE-seq detected novel editing sites in various repeat elements as well as in short hairpins. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these edited mRNAs are associated with transcription, energy metabolism, and neurological disorders, providing new insights into various aspects of human brain functions.},

abstract = {A comprehensive investigation of ribosomal genes in complete genomes from 66 different species allows us to address the distribution of r-proteins between and within the three primary domains. Thirty-four r-protein families are represented in all domains but 33 families are specific to Archaea and Eucarya, providing evidence for specialisation at an early stage of evolution between the bacterial lineage and the lineage leading to Archaea and Eukaryotes. With only one specific r-protein, the archaeal ribosome appears to be a small-scale model of the eukaryotic one in terms of protein composition. However, the mechanism of evolution of the protein component of the ribosome appears dramatically different in Archaea. In Bacteria and Eucarya, a restricted number of ribosomal genes can be lost with a bias toward losses in intracellular pathogens. In Archaea, losses implicate 15% of the ribosomal genes revealing an unexpected plasticity of the translation apparatus and the pattern of gene losses indicates a progressive elimination of ribosomal genes in the course of archaeal evolution. This first documented case of reductive evolution at the domain scale provides a new framework for discussing the shape of the universal tree of life and the selective forces directing the evolution of prokaryotes.},

However, the precise relationship between the regularized parameter and the
number of false edges in GGM estimation is unclear. Hence, it is impossible to
evaluate their performance rigorously. In this paper, we propose an alternative
method by a multiple testing procedure. Based on our new test statistics for
conditional dependence, we propose a simultaneous testing procedure for
conditional dependence in GGM. Our method can control the false discovery rate
(FDR) asymptotically. The numerical performance of the proposed method shows
that our method works quite well.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Accurate time series for biological processes are difficult to estimate due to problems of synchronization, temporal sampling and rate heterogeneity. Methods are needed that can utilize multi-dimensional data, such as those resulting from DNA microarray experiments, in order to reconstruct time series from unordered or poorly ordered sets of observations.

RESULTS:We present a set of algorithms for estimating temporal orderings from unordered sets of sample elements. The techniques we describe are based on modifications of a minimum-spanning tree calculated from a weighted, undirected graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying these techniques to an artificial data set as well as several gene expression data sets derived from DNA microarray experiments. In addition to estimating orderings, the techniques we describe also provide useful heuristics for assessing relevant properties of sample datasets such as noise and sampling intensity, and we show how a data structure called a PQ-tree can be used to represent uncertainty in a reconstructed ordering.

AVAILABILITY:Academic implementations of the ordering algorithms are available as source code (in the programming language Python) on our web site, along with documentation on their use. The artificial 'jelly roll' data set upon which the algorithm was tested is also available from this web site. The publicly available gene expression data may be found at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/ and http://caulobacter.stanford.edu/CellCycle/.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is hypothesized to be caused by an imbalance between $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) production and clearance that leads to A$\beta$ accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS). A$\beta$ production and clearance are key targets in the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. However, there has not been direct evidence of altered A$\beta$ production or clearance in Alzheimer's disease. By using metabolic labeling, we measured A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 production and clearance rates in the CNS of participants with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls. Clearance rates for both A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 were impaired in Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. On average, there were no differences in A$\beta$40 or A$\beta$42 production rates. Thus, the common late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease is characterized by an overall impairment in A$\beta$ clearance.},

abstract = {Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of severe genetic neurodegenerative disorders. A multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome was found in an infant presenting with a progressive leukoencephalopathy. Homozygosity mapping, whole exome sequencing, and functional studies were used to define the underlying molecular defect. Respiratory chain studies in skeletal muscle isolated from the proband revealed a combined deficiency of complexes I and II. In addition, western blotting indicated lack of protein lipoylation. The combination of these findings was suggestive for a defect in the iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein assembly pathway. SNP array identified loss of heterozygosity in large chromosomal regions, covering the NFU1 and BOLA3, and the IBA57 and ABCB10 candidate genes, in 2p15-p11.2 and 1q31.1-q42.13, respectively. A homozygous c.436C > T (p.Arg146Trp) variant was detected in IBA57 using whole exome sequencing. Complementation studies in a HeLa cell line depleted for IBA57 showed that the mutant protein with the semi-conservative amino acid exchange was unable to restore the biochemical phenotype indicating a loss-of-function mutation of IBA57. In conclusion, defects in the Fe/S protein assembly gene IBA57 can cause autosomal recessive neurodegeneration associated with progressive leukodystrophy and fatal outcome at young age. In the affected patient, the biochemical phenotype was characterized by a defect in the respiratory chain complexes I and II and a decrease in mitochondrial protein lipoylation, both resulting from impaired assembly of Fe/S clusters.},

abstract = {Yeast cells were induced to proliferate peroxisomes, and microarray transcriptional profiling was used to identify PEX genes encoding peroxins involved in peroxisome assembly and genes involved in peroxisome function. Clustering algorithms identified 224 genes with expression profiles similar to those of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins and genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis. Several previously uncharacterized genes were identified, two of which, YPL112c and YOR084w, encode proteins of the peroxisomal membrane and matrix, respectively. Ypl112p, renamed Pex25p, is a novel peroxin required for the regulation of peroxisome size and maintenance. These studies demonstrate the utility of comparative gene profiling as an alternative to functional assays to identify genes with roles in peroxisome biogenesis.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:The deconvolution of isoform expression from RNA-seq remains challenging because of non-uniform read sampling and subtle differences among isoforms.

RESULTS:We present a weighted-log-likelihood expectation maximization method on isoform quantification (WemIQ). WemIQ integrates an effective bias removal with a weighted expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to distribute reads among isoforms efficiently. The weight represents the oversampling or undersampling of sequence reads and is estimated through a generalized Poisson model without any presumption on the bias sources and formats. WemIQ significantly improves the quantification of isoform and gene expression as well as the derived exon inclusion rates. It provides robust expression estimates across different laboratories and protocols, which is valuable for the integrative analysis of RNA-seq. For the recent single-cell RNA-seq data, WemIQ also provides the opportunity to distinguish bias heterogeneity from true biological heterogeneity and uncovers smaller cell-to-cell expression variability.},

abstract = {Repair and regeneration of adult skeletal muscle are mediated by satellite cells. In healthy muscle these rare mononucleate muscle precursor cells are mitotically quiescent. Upon muscle injury or degeneration, members of this self-renewing pool are activated to proliferate and then differentiate. Here we analyzed in single satellite cells the expression of a set of regulatory genes that are candidates for causal roles in satellite cell activation, maturation, and differentiation. Individual cells were identified as satellite cells and selected for analysis based on their physical association with single explanted myofibers or their position beneath the basal lamina in unperturbed muscle tissue. Using a multiplex single-cell RT-PCR assay we simultaneously monitored expression of all four MyoD family regulators of muscle determination and differentiation (MRFs) together with two candidate markers of satellite cell identity, c-met and m-cadherin. By making these measurements on large numbers of individual cells during the time course of satellite cell activation, we were able to define which expression states (possible combinations of the six genes) were represented and to specify how the representation of each state changed with time. Activated satellite cells began to express either MyoD or myf5 first among the MRFs; most cells then expressed both myf-5 and MyoD simultaneously; myogenin came on later in cells expressing both MyoD and myf5; and many cells ultimately expressed all four MRFs simultaneously. The results for fiber-associated satellite cells from either predominantly fast or slow muscles were indistinguishable from each other. The c-met receptor tyrosine kinase was also monitored because it is a candidate for mediating activation of quiescent satellite cells (Allen et al., 1995) and because it might also be a candidate molecular marker for satellite cells. A significant difficulty in studying mouse satellite cells has been the absence of molecular markers that could identify them in the quiescent state before expression of MRFs or desmin and distinguish them from fibroblasts. We show here that c-met receptor is present beneath the basal lamina on presumptive satellite cells in intact muscle and that c-met mRNA and protein are expressed by all myofiber-associated satellite cells from the time of explant through the course of activation, proliferation, and differentiation. c-met was not detected in muscle-derived fibroblasts or in other mononucleate cells from healthy muscle explants. When compared directly with m-cadherin, which has previously been suggested as a marker for quiescent satellite cells, m-cadherin mRNA was detected only in a small subset of satellite cells at early times after myofiber explant. However, at late times following activation (by 96 hr in this fiber culture system), c-met and m-cadherin were uniformly coexpressed. From the individual satellite cell expression types observed, a model of the satellite cell population at rest and during the time course of activation was generated.},

abstract = {Although two-color fluorescent DNA microarrays are now standard equipment in many molecular biology laboratories, methods for identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray data are still evolving. Here, we report a refined test for differentially expressed genes which does not rely on gene expression ratios but directly compares a series of repeated measurements of the two dye intensities for each gene. This test uses a statistical model to describe multiplicative and additive errors influencing an array experiment, where model parameters are estimated from observed intensities for all genes using the method of maximum likelihood. A generalized likelihood ratio test is performed for each gene to determine whether, under the model, these intensities are significantly different. We use this method to identify significant differences in gene expression among yeast cells growing in galactose-stimulating versus non-stimulating conditions and compare our results with current approaches for identifying differentially-expressed genes.

abstract = {Peripheral blood is the primary source of lymphoid cells for investigation of the human immune system. Its use is facilitated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation-a simple and rapid method of purifying peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that takes advantage of the density differences between mononuclear cells and other elements found in the blood sample. Thus, cells are distributed in the solution in layers based on the differences in their density/size. Additional purification methods can be employed as the mononuclear cell sample can be purified from monocytes by adherence or by exposure to L-leucine methyl ester; these methods are described for both procedures. Cord blood and peripheral blood from infants contain immature cells, including nucleated red cells, which can result in significant contamination of the mononuclear cell layer, and removal of these cells requires additional steps that are described. The isolation procedures presented here can also be applied to cell populations derived from tissues.},

abstract = {The complexity of mammalian transcriptomes is compounded by alternative splicing which allows one gene to produce multiple transcript isoforms. However, transcriptome comparison has been limited to differential analysis at the gene level instead of the individual transcript isoform level. High-throughput sequencing technologies and high-resolution tiling arrays provide an unprecedented opportunity to compare transcriptomes at the level of individual splice variants. However, sequence read coverage or probe intensity at each position may represent a family of splice variants instead of one single isoform. Here we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model, BASIS (Bayesian Analysis of Splicing IsoformS), to infer the differential expression level of each transcript isoform in response to two conditions. A latent variable was introduced to perform direct statistical selection of differentially expressed isoforms. Model parameters were inferred based on an ergodic Markov chain generated by our Gibbs sampler. BASIS has the ability to borrow information across different probes (or positions) from the same genes and different genes. BASIS can handle the heteroskedasticity of probe intensity or sequence read coverage. We applied BASIS to a human tiling-array data set and a mouse RNA-seq data set. Some of the predictions were validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR experiments.},

We report the simultaneous analysis of single cells at five commonly deleted dystrophin exons and at the ZFX/ZFY loci. Ninety three percent of PEP reactions with single amniocytes, chorionic villus cells and blastomeres were successful, and a blinded analysis of single lymphoblasts from affected males resulted in 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating its applicability in preimplantation prevention of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Transfer of unaffected male embryos and improved diagnostic reliability are achieved with the ability to perform replicate multilocus analyses from the same blastomere.},

journal = {Stem Cell},
year = {2012},
volume = {11},
number = {4},
pages = {505--516},
month = oct,
annote = {RGC = radial glial cell
VZ = ventricular zone
IPC = intermediate progenitor cell (aka basal progenitor cell)
SVZ = subventricular zone
NB = neuroblast
GMC = ganglion mother cell
RNP = ribonucleoprotein
CNS = central nervous system
NPC = neural progenitor cell

Figure 1.
A. First panel: labeling all the areas of the mouse cortex. At embryonic day 15, co-localization of Stau2 and NEstin at the border of the SVZ/VZ and LV (lateral ventricle). Bottom panel is same as middle, but a different example. Also co-localizes with neuronal marker beta-tubulin III --{\&}gt; differentiating neurons express Stau2
B. ZO1 = tight junction protein. Staining for Stau2 and ZO1 shows that Stau2 is indeed expressed exactly at the border between the two regions.

Figure 2.
A. Immunostaining in E13-E14 cortical cells undergoing mitosis, showing asymmetric division of Stau2. Q: why is Nestin in only one panel?
A'. (this is a thing now??) Zooming in on one cell's staining.
B. Quantification of stau2 distribution in symmetric vs asymmetric division. umm of course these would be "***"-significant difference... Also, see 48% asymmetric in E13-14 compared to 6.7% in E10-11
C. Q: What is the white dotted circle? Top panel, VZ cells. Stau2 protein not differentially distributed. y-Tubulin shows the centromeres. 
Bottom panel, LV cells. Stau protein differentially distributed. Beta-catenin shows cell junctions.

Figure 3.
Used their old "cell pair assay" to image original cells, then their daughters, and observe the distirbution of Stau2 between them.
A. Tbr2: IPC marker (used to mark basal GMC here). Examples of symmetric/asymmetric division of Stau2.
B. Table showing Stau2 staining symmetry at different embryonic cell stages. Sub-table showing distribution of Tbr2 staining within each Stau2 staining (columns sum to 100%) This was to see whether the basal-biased asymmetrical differentiation was conserved from flies to mouse. WE see that if Tbr2 is asymmetric, then Stau2 is probably asymmetric too, especially in E14. ....this should have been a stacked bar graph for Stau2 with an inset for each of the Tbr2 stainings.........
C. If stau2 was asymmetrically distributed, then did Tbr2 also appear with it? Percentage-wise, yes, saw more cases like this in E14.

Figure 4. In vitro assessment of stau2 knockdown.
A, C: Stau2 shRNA --{\&}gt; smaller percentage of cells with apical progenitor cell marker Pax6. C is a quantifiaction of the images.
B, D: Stau2 shRNA --{\&}gt; larger percentage of cells with IPC marker Tbr2.
E. Quantification of immunostaining, showing slightly more beta-tubulin III after treating with shSTau2
F. shStau2 --{\&}gt; decrease in number of cells per clone (smaller clone size). This suggests that Stau2 is important in promoting differentiation.

Figure 5.
A. What are the GFP+ cells? Why are they in the control? I thought GFP was in the lentivirus. Anyways, tehere are more GFP+ cells in the Intermediate Zone (IZ) than in control cells. Bottom panel, many more GFP+ cells stayed in the VZ/SVZ and did not reach the cortical plate.
B. Quantification of A. The IZ seems incorrect because it looks like many many more are GFP+. Is this just them picking an especially good example?
C. Smaller percentage of Pax6+ and GFP+ cells with shStau2
D. Larger percentage of Tbr2+ and GFP+ cells with shStau2.
C{\&}amp;D =={\&}gt; progenitor population is skewed towards IPCs
E. Increase in percentage of Tbr1+ GFP+ cells, which indicates premature neuronal differentiation.
F. Larger percentage of cells exited teh cell cycle (used BrdU labeling of pregnant animals electoporated in utero with Stau2 or control shRNA). They're trying to say that these cells are prematurely exiting the cell cycle.
G. What happens when you <b>overexpress</b> Stau2? In the Stau2 overexpression, see abnormal periventricular cell masses, which also stained for neuronal marker NeuN. Right apnel, merged DAPI+GFP, GFP, and Ctip2, a deep layer neuronal marker.

Figure 6.
A. Performed RIP-Chip of Stau2. Top 80th percentile of probes were kept. 3 datasets:
1. 1.5x fold change in Stau2 RIP vs input RNA
2. 1.5x fold change in T7 negative control vs input
3. (1) - (2)
Used (3): 1,566 genes. This table shows the top Gene Ontology enrichment hits for Stau2 RIP targets. Lots of cell cycle exit/mitosis, etc regulators.
B. Also saw centrosome-associated Bardet-Biedl syndrom (BBS) genes, and this table shows the enrichment and p value of these genes.
C. Performed qPCR after IP'ing for Stau2and saw enrichment over input RNA.

Figure 7.
A, B. RNA-FISH showing polarized localization of Bbs2 (metaphase) mRNA and Trim32 (anaphase/telophase) mRNA in daughter cells. These genes are from their BBS list in Figure 6. Sometimes saw very brightly colored spots --{\&}gt; localization to BBSome or centrosome?
C. After Stau2 knockdown, disruption of Bbs2 polarized mitotic localization, 
D. and of Trim32 mRNA (less bright, but also symmetric).
E. Asymmetric localization of Bbs2 protein during mitosis, and in a cell pair. (what about after shRNA of Stau2???)},

abstract = {We participated in the fold recognition and homology sections of CASP5 using primarily in-house software. The central feature of our structure prediction strategy involved the ability to generate good sequence-to-structure alignments and to quickly transform them into models that could be evaluated both with energy-based methods and manually. The in-house tools we used include: a) HMAP (Hybrid Multidimensional Alignment Profile)-a profile-to-profile alignment method that is derived from sequence-enhanced multiple structure alignments in core regions, and sequence motifs in non-structurally conserved regions. b) NEST-a fast model building program that applies an "artificial evolution" algorithm to construct a model from a given template and alignment. c) GRASP2-a new structure and alignment visualization program incorporating multiple structure superposition and domain database scanning modules. These methods were combined with model evaluation based on all atom and simplified physical-chemical energy functions. All of these methods were under development during CASP5 and consequently a great deal of manual analysis was carried out at each stage of the prediction process. This interactive model building procedure has several advantages and suggests important ways in which our and other methods can be improved, examples of which are provided.},

abstract = {High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) enables quantification and identification of transcripts at single-base resolution. Recently, longer sequence reads become available thanks to the development of new types of sequencing technologies as well as improvements in chemical reagents for the Next Generation Sequencers. Although several computational methods have been proposed for quantifying gene expression levels from RNA-Seq data, they are not sufficiently optimized for longer reads (e.g. >250 bp). We propose TIGAR2, a statistical method for quantifying transcript isoforms from fixed and variable length RNA-Seq data. Our method models substitution, deletion, and insertion errors of sequencers based on gapped-alignments of reads to the reference cDNA sequences so that sensitive read-aligners such as Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM are effectively incorporated in our pipeline. Also, a heuristic algorithm is implemented in variational Bayesian inference for faster computation. We apply TIGAR2 to both simulation data and real data of human samples and evaluate performance of transcript quantification with TIGAR2 in comparison to existing methods. TIGAR2 is a sensitive and accurate tool for quantifying transcript isoform abundances from RNA-Seq data. Our method performs better than existing methods for the fixed-length reads (100 bp, 250 bp, 500 bp, and 1000 bp of both single-end and paired-end) and variable-length reads, especially for reads longer than 250 bp.},

abstract = {This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Topics addressed include incidence, prevalence, mortality rates, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society. The report also explores issues that arise when people with AD and other dementias live alone. The characteristics, risks, and unmet needs of this population are described. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have AD, including approximately 200,000 age <65 years who comprise the younger-onset AD population. Over the coming decades, the aging of the baby boom generation is projected to result in an additional 10 million people with AD. Today, someone in America develops AD every 68 seconds. By 2050, there is expected to be one new case of AD every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and AD prevalence is projected to be 11 million to 16 million. Dramatic increases in the number of "oldest-old" (those age $\ge$85 years) across all racial and ethnic groups are expected to contribute to the increased prevalence of AD. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age $\ge$65 years. Although the proportions of deaths due to other major causes of death have decreased in the last several years, the proportion due to AD has risen significantly. Between 2000 and 2008, the proportion of deaths due to heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased by 13%, 20%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the proportion due to AD increased by 66%. In 2011, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.4 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $210 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age \ge65 years with AD and other dementias are three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. In 2012, payments for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age \ge65 years with AD and other dementias are expected to be $200 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 800,000 people with AD (one in seven) live alone, and up to half of them do not have an identifiable caregiver. People with dementia who live alone are exposed to risks that exceed the risks encountered by people with dementia who live with others, including inadequate self-care, malnutrition, untreated medical conditions, falls, wandering from home unattended, and accidental deaths.},

abstract = {Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, in which genomically encoded adenosine is changed to inosine in RNA, is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). This fine-tuning mechanism is critical during normal development and diseases, particularly in relation to brain functions. A-to-I RNA editing has also been hypothesized to be a driving force in human brain evolution. A large number of RNA editing sites have recently been identified, mostly as a result of the development of deep sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. Deciphering the functional consequences of RNA editing events is challenging, but emerging genome engineering approaches may expedite new discoveries. To understand how RNA editing is dynamically regulated, it is imperative to construct a spatiotemporal atlas at the species, tissue and cell levels. Future studies will need to identify the cis and trans regulatory factors that drive the selectivity and frequency of RNA editing. We anticipate that recent technological advancements will aid researchers in acquiring a much deeper understanding of the functions and regulation of RNA editing.},

To this end, we used DNA microarrays and samples from yeast cultures synchronized by three independent methods: alpha factor arrest, elutriation, and arrest of a cdc15 temperature-sensitive mutant. Using periodicity and correlation algorithms, we identified 800 genes that meet an objective minimum criterion for cell cycle regulation. In separate experiments, designed to examine the effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p or the B-type cyclin Clb2p, we found that the mRNA levels of more than half of these 800 genes respond to one or both of these cyclins. Furthermore, we analyzed our set of cell cycle-regulated genes for known and new promoter elements and show that several known elements (or variations thereof) contain information predictive of cell cycle regulation. A full description and complete data sets are available at http://cellcycle-www.stanford.edu},

abstract = {From a large-scale screen using splicing microarrays and RT-PCR, we identified 63 alternative splicing (AS) events that are coordinated in 3 distinct temporal patterns during mouse heart development. More than half of these splicing transitions are evolutionarily conserved between mouse and chicken. Computational analysis of the introns flanking these splicing events identified enriched and conserved motifs including binding sites for CUGBP and ETR-3-like factors (CELF), muscleblind-like (MBNL) and Fox proteins. We show that CELF proteins are down-regulated >10-fold during heart development, and MBNL1 protein is concomitantly up-regulated nearly 4-fold. Using transgenic and knockout mice, we show that reproducing the embryonic expression patterns for CUGBP1 and MBNL1 in adult heart induces the embryonic splicing patterns for more than half of the developmentally regulated AS transitions. These findings indicate that CELF and MBNL proteins are determinative for a large subset of splicing transitions that occur during postnatal heart development.},

We collected all available 'complete' eukaryotic proteomes and Escherichia coli, and calculated ortholog groups for all 595 species pairs using the InParanoid program. This resulted in 2 642 187 pairwise ortholog groups in total. The orthology-based species relations are presented in an orthophylogram. InParanoid clusters contain one or more orthologs from each of the two species. Multiple orthologs in the same species, i.e. inparalogs, result from gene duplications after the species divergence. A new InParanoid website has been developed which is optimized for speed both for users and for updating the system. The XML output format has been improved for efficient processing of the InParanoid ortholog clusters.},

abstract = {The VH gene repertoire of human peripheral B cells was analyzed using PCR analysis of individual blood B cells. Because genomic DNA of single B cells was analyzed, data from both productive and nonproductive VDJ rearrangements were obtained. Nine out of 75 B cells contained both functional and nonfunctional rearrangement products, whereas 62/75 had a single productive VDJ rearrangement. The distribution of VH families was ordered in accordance with the germline complexity, although a bias toward VH3 and some of its members was found. This bias was noted in both the productively and nonproductively rearranged repertoires, indicating that it resulted from molecular and not selective processes. Evidence for negative selection of certain VH3 and VH4 family members was noted in that they were found less often as productive than nonproductive VDJ rearrangements. In addition, evidence for positive selection based on CDR3 was obtained, in that JH6 and DXP'1 were found at a higher frequency in the productively compared with the nonproductively rearranged repertoire. The CDR3 segments were markedly heterogenous, with a much greater degree of variability noted in the nonproductive VDJ rearrangements. Finally, a much greater frequency of mutations was noted in the nonproductively rearranged VH genes within individual B cells. These results have begun to delineate the human peripheral B cell repertoire and identify processes that shape it both positively and negatively.},

abstract = {RNA editing is increasingly recognized as a molecular mechanism regulating RNA activity and recoding proteins. Here we surveyed the global landscape of RNA editing in human brain tissues and identified three unique patterns of A-to-I RNA editing rates during cortical development: stable high, stable low and increasing. RNA secondary structure and the temporal expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) contribute to cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms of these RNA editing patterns, respectively. Interestingly, the increasing pattern was associated with neuronal maturation, correlated with mRNA abundance and potentially influenced miRNA binding energy. Gene ontology analyses implicated the increasing pattern in vesicle or organelle membrane-related genes and glutamate signaling pathways. We also found that the increasing pattern was selectively perturbed in spinal cord injury and glioblastoma. Our findings reveal global and dynamic aspects of RNA editing in brain, providing new insight into epitranscriptional regulation of sequence diversity.},

Moreover, the distribution of proteins among these folds is highly non-homogeneous -- some folds and superfamilies are extremely abundant, but most are rare. Protein folds and families encoded in diverse genomes show similar size distributions with notable mathematical properties, which also extend to the number of connections between domains in multidomain proteins. All these distributions follow asymptotic power laws, such as have been identified in a wide variety of biological and physical systems, and which are typically associated with scale-free networks. These findings suggest that genome evolution is driven by extremely general mechanisms based on the preferential attachment principle.},

abstract = {A number of automatic protein structure comparison methods have been proposed; however, their similarity score functions are often decided by the researchers' intuition and trial-and-error, and not by theoretical background. We propose a novel theory to evaluate protein structure similarity, which is based on the Markov transition model of evolution. Our similarity score between structures i and j is defined as log P(j --> i)/P(i), where P(j --> i) is the probability that structure j changes to structure i during the evolutionary process, and P(i) is the probability that structure i appears by chance. This is a reasonable definition of structure similarity, especially for finding evolutionarily related (homologous) similarity. The probability P(j --> i) is estimated by the Markov transition model, which is similar to the Dayhoff's substitution model between amino acids. To estimate the parameters of the model, homologous protein structure pairs are collected using sequence similarity, and the numbers of structure transitions within the pairs are counted. Next these numbers are transformed to a transition probability matrix of the Markov transition. Transition probabilities for longer time are obtained by multiplying the probability matrix by itself several times. In this study, we generated three types of structure similarity scores: an environment score, a residue-residue distance score, and a secondary structure elements (SSE) score. Using these scores, we developed the structure comparison program, Matras (MArkovian TRAnsition of protein Structure). It employs a hierarchical alignment algorithm, in which a rough alignment is first obtained by SSEs, and then is improved with more detailed functions. We attempted an all-versus-all comparison of the SCOP database, and evaluated its ability to recognize a superfamily relationship, which was manually assigned to be homologous in the SCOP database. A comparison with the FSSP database shows that our program can recognize more homologous similarity than FSSP. We also discuss the reliability of our method, by studying the disagreement between structural classifications by Matras and SCOP.},

abstract = {Computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors (cells) jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs. Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly's nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.},

Unlike previous approaches that relied primarily on functional information from expression data, the GRAM algorithm explicitly links genes to the factors that regulate them by incorporating DNA binding data, which provide direct physical evidence of regulatory interactions. We use the GRAM algorithm to describe a genome-wide regulatory network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using binding information for 106 transcription factors profiled in rich medium conditions data from over 500 expression experiments. We also present a genome-wide location analysis data set for regulators in yeast cells treated with rapamycin, and use the GRAM algorithm to provide biological insights into this regulatory network},

abstract = {RNA editing enhances the diversity of gene products at the post-transcriptional level. Approaches for genome-wide identification of RNA editing face two main challenges: separating true editing sites from false discoveries and accurate estimation of editing levels. We developed an approach to analyze transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-seq) for global identification of RNA editing in cells for which whole-genome sequencing data are available. We applied the method to analyze RNA-seq data of a human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG. Around 10,000 DNA-RNA differences were identified, the majority being putative A-to-I editing sites. These predicted A-to-I events were associated with a low false-discovery rate (∼5%). Moreover, the estimated editing levels from RNA-seq correlated well with those based on traditional clonal sequencing. Our results further facilitated unbiased characterization of the sequence and evolutionary features flanking predicted A-to-I editing sites and discovery of a conserved RNA structural motif that may be functionally relevant to editing. Genes with predicted A-to-I editing were significantly enriched with those known to be involved in cancer, supporting the potential importance of cancer-specific RNA editing. A similar profile of DNA-RNA differences as in U87MG was predicted for another RNA-seq data set obtained from primary breast cancer samples. Remarkably, significant overlap exists between the putative editing sites of the two transcriptomes despite their difference in cell type, cancer type, and genomic backgrounds. Our approach enabled de novo identification of the RNA editome, which sets the stage for further mechanistic studies of this important step of post-transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important class of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that regulate gene expression by targeting messenger RNAs. However, assigning miRNAs to their regulatory target genes remains technically challenging. Recently, high-throughput CLIP-Seq and degradome sequencing (Degradome-Seq) methods have been applied to identify the sites of Argonaute interaction and miRNA cleavage sites, respectively. In this study, we introduce a novel database, starBase (sRNA target Base), which we have developed to facilitate the comprehensive exploration of miRNA-target interaction maps from CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data. The current version includes high-throughput sequencing data generated from 21 CLIP-Seq and 10 Degradome-Seq experiments from six organisms. By analyzing millions of mapped CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq reads, we identified ∼1 million Ago-binding clusters and ∼2 million cleaved target clusters in animals and plants, respectively. Analyses of these clusters, and of target sites predicted by 6 miRNA target prediction programs, resulted in our identification of approximately 400,000 and approximately 66,000 miRNA-target regulatory relationships from CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data, respectively. Furthermore, two web servers were provided to discover novel miRNA target sites from CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data. Our web implementation supports diverse query types and exploration of common targets, gene ontologies and pathways. The starBase is available at http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/.},

abstract = {c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase are activated by stress and are implicated in regulation of apoptosis in several tissues. However, their contribution to stress-induced apoptosis in CNS neurons is not well defined. Here we investigated the role of JNK and p38 in cortical neuron apoptosis caused by sodium arsenite treatment. Sodium arsenite is an environmental toxicant that causes developmental defects in the CNS. Treatment of cortical neurons with sodium arsenite activated p38 and JNK3 but not JNK1 or JNK2. It also induced c-Jun phosphorylation. Furthermore, sodium arsenite induced cortical neuron apoptosis. This apoptosis was attenuated by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38, and by CEP-1347, an inhibitor of JNK activation. Expression of dominant-interfering mutants of the JNK or p38 pathways inhibited apoptosis induced by arsenite, whereas expression of constitutive active mutants for either pathway induced apoptosis. Moreover, the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fluoromethylketone as well as expression of bcl-2 or bcl-xL inhibited cortical neuron apoptosis induced by arsenite or by constitutive activation of JNK or p38. These data indicate that both JNK and p38 contribute to arsenite-induced apoptosis in primary CNS neurons, and this apoptosis requires the bcl-2-caspase pathway. This is the first evidence that a specific JNK isoform is differentially activated by stress and contributes to neuronal apoptosis.},

Mutant hearts have disorganized cardiomyocytes, impaired contractility, and abnormal excitation-contraction coupling activities. RNA-seq analyses of Hnrnpu mutant hearts revealed extensive defects in alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs encoding proteins known to be critical for normal heart development and function, including Titin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (Camk2d). Loss of hnRNP U expression in cardiomyocytes also leads to aberrant splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding the excitation-contraction coupling component Junctin. We found that the protein product of an alternatively spliced Junctin isoform is N-glycosylated at a specific asparagine site that is required for interactions with specific protein partners.

abstract = {AIMS:Compared with other categories of drugs, such as antibiotics and NSAIDs, antiepileptic therapies are associated with a high incidence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). We previously reported that carbamazepine (CBZ)-SJS/TEN is strongly associated with the HLA-B*1502 in Han Chinese, which has been confirmed in other Southeast Asian countries where the allele is prevalent. Here, we extend the study of HLA susceptibility to three different antiepileptic drugs, phenytoin (PHT), lamotrigine (LTG) and oxcarbazepine (OXC), which have structure similarity to CBZ.

MATERIALS {\&}{\#}38; METHODS:We carried out a case-control association study. We enrolled 26 PHT-, six LTG- and three OXC-induced SJS/TEN patients, 113 PHT-tolerant and 67 LTG-tolerant subjects who were on the drug, respectively, for more than 3 months without the adverse reactions, and 93 normal subjects from the general population. The HLA-A, B, C and DRB1 genotypes were determined.

RESULTS:We found that HLA-B*1502 was present in eight out of 26 (30.8%) PHT-SJS/TEN (OR: 5.1; 95% CI: 1.8-15.1; p = 0.0041), two out of six (33%) LTG-SJS (odds ratio [OR]: 5.1; 95% CI: 0.8-33.8; p = 0.1266) and three out of three (100%) OXC-SJS (OR: 80.7; 95% CI: 3.8-1714.4; p = 8.4 x 10(-4)) patients. In addition, HLA-B*1301, Cw*0801 and DRB1*1602 also showed an association with PHT-SJS/TEN (p = 0.0128-0.0281; OR: 3.0-4.3).

CONCLUSION:Our results indicate that OXC, PHT and LTG, which possess an aromatic ring just as CBZ does, when causing SJS/TEN, share a common risk allele. Aromatic antiepileptic drugs causing SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 carriers may act on a similar pathogenetic mechanism, although other genetic/nongenetic factor(s) may also contribute to the pathomechanism of the disease. We suggest that aromatic antiepileptic drugs, including CBZ, OXC and PHT, should be avoided in the B*1502 carrier and caution should also be exercised for LTG.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Novel technologies brought in unprecedented amounts of high-throughput sequencing data along with great challenges in their analysis and interpretation. The percent-spliced-in (PSI, ) metric estimates the incidence of single-exon-skipping events and can be computed directly by counting reads that align to known or predicted splice junctions. However, the majority of human splicing events are more complex than single-exon skipping.

RESULTS:In this short report, we present a framework that generalizes the metric to arbitrary classes of splicing events. We change the view from exon centric to intron centric and split the value of into two indices, and , measuring the rate of splicing at the 5' and 3' end of the intron, respectively. The advantage of having two separate indices is that they deconvolute two distinct elementary acts of the splicing reaction. The completeness of splicing index is decomposed in a similar way. This framework is implemented as bam2ssj, a BAM-file-processing pipeline for strand-specific counting of reads that align to splice junctions or overlap with splice sites. It can be used as a consistent protocol for quantifying splice junctions from RNA-seq data because no such standard procedure currently exists.

AVAILABILITY:The C code of bam2ssj is open source and is available at https://github.com/pervouchine/bam2ssj

abstract = {Genetic recombination contributes to the diversity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Productive HIV-1 recombination is, however, dependent on both the number of HIV-1 genomes per infected cell and the genetic relationship between these viral genomes. A detailed analysis of the number of proviruses and their genetic relationship in infected cells isolated from peripheral blood and tissue compartments is therefore important for understanding HIV-1 recombination, genetic diversity and the dynamics of HIV-1 infection. To address these issues, we used a previously developed single-cell sequencing technique to quantify and genetically characterize individual HIV-1 DNA molecules from single cells in lymph node tissue and peripheral blood. Analysis of memory and na{\"\i}ve CD4(+) T cells from paired lymph node and peripheral blood samples from five untreated chronically infected patients revealed that the majority of these HIV-1-infected cells (>90%) contain only one copy of HIV-1 DNA, implying a limited potential for productive recombination in virus produced by these cells in these two compartments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed genetic similarity of HIV-1 DNA in memory and na{\"\i}ve CD4(+) T-cells from lymph node, peripheral blood and HIV-1 RNA from plasma, implying exchange of virus and/or infected cells between these compartments in untreated chronic infection.},

The IUPred server presents a novel algorithm for predicting such regions from amino acid sequences by estimating their total pairwise interresidue interaction energy, based on the assumption that IUP sequences do not fold due to their inability to form sufficient stabilizing interresidue interactions. Optional to the prediction are built-in parameter sets optimized for predicting short or long disordered regions and structured domains.},

Compared with existing methods, Smart-Seq has improved read coverage across transcripts, which enhances detailed analyses of alternative transcript isoforms and identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We determined the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that although gene expression estimates from single cells have increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we identified distinct gene expression patterns, including candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells. Our protocol will be useful for addressing fundamental biological problems requiring genome-wide transcriptome profiling in rare cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Measuring allelic RNA expression ratios is a powerful approach for detecting cis-acting regulatory variants, RNA editing, loss of heterozygosity in cancer, copy number variation, and allele-specific epigenetic gene silencing. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a genome-wide tool for identifying allelic expression imbalance (AEI), but numerous factors bias allelic RNA ratio measurements. Here, we compare RNA-Seq allelic ratios measured in nine different human brain regions with a highly sensitive and accurate SNaPshot measure of allelic RNA ratios, identifying factors affecting reliable allelic ratio measurement. Accounting for these factors, we subsequently surveyed the variability of RNA editing across brain regions and across individuals.

RESULTS:We find that RNA-Seq allelic ratios from standard alignment methods correlate poorly with SNaPshot, but applying alternative alignment strategies and correcting for observed biases significantly improves correlations. Deploying these methods on a transcriptome-wide basis in nine brain regions from a single individual, we identified genes with AEI across all regions (SLC1A3, NHP2L1) and many others with region-specific AEI. In dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues from 14 individuals, we found evidence for frequent regulatory variants affecting RNA expression in tens to hundreds of genes, depending on stringency for assigning AEI. Further, we find that the extent and variability of RNA editing is similar across brain regions and across individuals.

CONCLUSIONS:These results identify critical factors affecting allelic ratios measured by RNA-Seq and provide a foundation for using this technology to screen allelic RNA expression on a transcriptome-wide basis. Using this technology as a screening tool reveals tens to hundreds of genes harboring frequent functional variants affecting RNA expression in the human brain. With respect to RNA editing, the similarities within and between individuals leads us to conclude that this post-transcriptional process is under heavy regulatory influence to maintain an optimal degree of editing for normal biological function.},

abstract = {Family 19 of the P450 super family is responsible for the conversion of C19 androgenic steroids to the corresponding estrogens, a reaction known as aromatization because it involves conversion of the delta4-3-one A-ring of the androgens to the corresponding phenolic A-ring characteristic of estrogens. The gene encoding human aromatase has been cloned and characterized and shown to be unusual compared to genes encoding other P450 enzymes, because there are numerous untranslated first exons that occur in aromatase transcripts in a tissue-specific fashion due to differential splicing as a consequence of the use of tissue-specific promoters. Thus, expression in the ovary uses a proximal promoter that is regulated primarily by cAMP. On the other hand, expression in the placenta uses a distal promoter located at least 40 kb upstream of the start of transcription that is regulated by retinoids. Other promoters are used in brain and adipose tissue. In the latter case, class I cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-11, as well as TNF-alpha, are important regulatory factors. A common 3'-splice junction located upstream of the start of translation is used in all of the splicing events involved in the use of these various promoters. Thus, the coding region of the transcripts, and hence the protein, are identical regardless of the tissue site of expression; what differs in a tissue-specific fashion is the 5'-end of the transcripts. This pattern of expression has great significance both from a phylogenetic and ontogenetic standpoint, as well as for the physiology and pathophysiology of estrogen formation, as will be discussed in this review.},

Following an introduction to the role of biosimulation in drug development, the authors go on to discuss the simulation of cells and tissues, as well as simulating drug action and effect. A further section is devoted to simulating networks and populations, and the whole is rounded off by a look at the potential for biosimulation in industrial drug development and for regulatory decisions.
Part of the authors are members of the BioSim Network of Excellence that encompasses more than 40 academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities dealing with drug development; other contributors come from industry, resulting in a cross-disciplinary expert reference.},

abstract = {The parasite Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for hundreds of millions of cases of malaria, and kills more than one million African children annually. Here we report an analysis of the genome sequence of P. falciparum clone 3D7. The 23-megabase nuclear genome consists of 14 chromosomes, encodes about 5,300 genes, and is the most (A + T)-rich genome sequenced to date. Genes involved in antigenic variation are concentrated in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes. Compared to the genomes of free-living eukaryotic microbes, the genome of this intracellular parasite encodes fewer enzymes and transporters, but a large proportion of genes are devoted to immune evasion and host-parasite interactions. Many nuclear-encoded proteins are targeted to the apicoplast, an organelle involved in fatty-acid and isoprenoid metabolism. The genome sequence provides the foundation for future studies of this organism, and is being exploited in the search for new drugs and vaccines to fight malaria.},

abstract = {Transcript quantification is a long-standing problem in genomics and estimating the relative abundance of alternatively-spliced isoforms from the same transcript is an important special case. Both problems have recently been illuminated by high-throughput RNA sequencing experiments which are quickly generating large amounts of data. However, much of the signal present in this data is corrupted or obscured by biases resulting in non-uniform and non-proportional representation of sequences from different transcripts. Many existing analyses attempt to deal with these and other biases with various task-specific approaches, which makes direct comparison between them difficult. However, two popular tools for isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks, have adopted a general probabilistic framework to model and mitigate these biases in a more general fashion. These advances motivate the need to investigate the effects of RNA-seq biases on the accuracy of different approaches for isoform quantification. We conduct the investigation by building models of increasing sophistication to account for noise introduced by the biases and compare their accuracy to the established approaches.},

abstract = {Computer analyses of the entire GenBank database were conducted to examine correlation between splicing sites and codon positions in reading frames. Intron insertion patterns (i.e., splicing site locations with respect to codon positions) have been analyzed for all of the 74 codons of all the eukaryote taxonomic groups: primates, rodents mammals, vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. We found that reading frames are interrupted by an intron at a codon boundary (as opposed to the middle of a codon) significantly more often than expected. This observation is consistent with the exon shuffling hypothesis, because exons that end at codon boundaries can be concatenated without causing a frame shift and thus are evolutionarily advantageous. On the other hand, when introns interrupt at the middles of codons, they exist in between the first and second bases much more frequently than between the second and third bases, despite the fact that boundaries between the first and second bases of codons are generally far more important than those between the second and third bases. The reason for this is not clear and yet to be explained. We also show that the length of an exon is a multiple of 3 more frequently than expected. Furthermore, the total length of two consecutive exons is also more frequently a multiple of 3. All the observations above are consistent with results recently published by Long, Rosenberg, and Gilbert (1995).},

Hierarchical clustering has been extensively used to analyze gene expression data, and we show how optimal leaf ordering can reveal biological structure that is not observed with an existing heuristic ordering method. For a tree with n leaves, there are 2(n-1) linear orderings consistent with the structure of the tree. Our optimal leaf ordering algorithm runs in time O(n(4)), and we present further improvements that make the running time of our algorithm practical.},

Cancer cells have adapted these pathways, allowing tumours to survive and even grow under hypoxic conditions, and tumour hypoxia is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to radiation therapy. Many elements of the hypoxia-response pathway are therefore good candidates for therapeutic targeting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Measuring allelic RNA expression ratios is a powerful approach for detecting cis-acting regulatory variants, RNA editing, loss of heterozygosity in cancer, copy number variation, and allele-specific epigenetic gene silencing. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a genome-wide tool for identifying allelic expression imbalance (AEI), but numerous factors bias allelic RNA ratio measurements. Here, we compare RNA-Seq allelic ratios measured in nine different human brain regions with a highly sensitive and accurate SNaPshot measure of allelic RNA ratios, identifying factors affecting reliable allelic ratio measurement. Accounting for these factors, we subsequently surveyed the variability of RNA editing across brain regions and across individuals.

RESULTS:We find that RNA-Seq allelic ratios from standard alignment methods correlate poorly with SNaPshot, but applying alternative alignment strategies and correcting for observed biases significantly improves correlations. Deploying these methods on a transcriptome-wide basis in nine brain regions from a single individual, we identified genes with AEI across all regions (SLC1A3, NHP2L1) and many others with region-specific AEI. In dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues from 14 individuals, we found evidence for frequent regulatory variants affecting RNA expression in tens to hundreds of genes, depending on stringency for assigning AEI. Further, we find that the extent and variability of RNA editing is similar across brain regions and across individuals.

CONCLUSIONS:These results identify critical factors affecting allelic ratios measured by RNA-Seq and provide a foundation for using this technology to screen allelic RNA expression on a transcriptome-wide basis. Using this technology as a screening tool reveals tens to hundreds of genes harboring frequent functional variants affecting RNA expression in the human brain. With respect to RNA editing, the similarities within and between individuals leads us to conclude that this post-transcriptional process is under heavy regulatory influence to maintain an optimal degree of editing for normal biological function.},

abstract = {The FOXP2 gene is required for normal development of speech and language. By isolating and sequencing FOXP2 genomic DNA fragments from a 49,000-year-old Iberian Neandertal and 50 present-day humans, we have identified substitutions in the gene shared by all or nearly all present-day humans but absent or polymorphic in Neandertals. One such substitution is localized in intron 8 and affects a binding site for the transcription factor POU3F2, which is highly conserved among vertebrates. We find that the derived allele of this site is less efficient than the ancestral allele in activating transcription from a reporter construct. The derived allele also binds less POU3F2 dimers than POU3F2 monomers compared with the ancestral allele. Because the substitution in the POU3F2 binding site is likely to alter the regulation of FOXP2 expression, and because it is localized in a region of the gene associated with a previously described signal of positive selection, it is a plausible candidate for having caused a recent selective sweep in the FOXP2 gene.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Alternative splicing is central for cellular processes and substantially increases transcriptome and proteome diversity. Aberrant splicing events often have pathological consequences and are associated with various diseases and cancer types. The emergence of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides an exciting new technology to analyse alternative splicing on a large scale. However, algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative splicing from short-read sequencing are not fully established yet and there are still no standard solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks.

RESULTS:We present a new method and software to predict genes that are differentially spliced between two different conditions using RNA-seq data. Our method uses geometric angles between the high dimensional vectors of exon read counts. With this, differential splicing can be detected even if the splicing events are composed of higher complexity and involve previously unknown splicing patterns. We applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical courses. We show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our method in the context of patient clustering. We verified our predictions by several methods including simulated experiments and complementary in silico analyses. We found a significant number of exons with specific regulatory splicing factor motifs for predicted genes and a substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative splicing. Furthermore, we could successfully exploit splicing information to cluster tissues and patients. Finally, we found additional evidence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalized read coverage plots and in reads that span exon-exon junctions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe cutaneous reactions caused by certain drugs, including antiepileptic carbamazepine. A strong association has been reported between human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Han Chinese patients. European studies suggested that HLA-B*1502 is not a universal marker but is ethnicity-specific for Asians.

AIM:To study the association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Indian patients.

METHODS:Eight individuals who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of SJS induced by carbamazepine were identified and HLA-B molecular typing was performed. HLA-B genotyping was carried out by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers.

RESULTS:Out of eight patients studied for genotype, six patients were found to have the HLA-B*1502 allele.

CONCLUSION:This study suggests an association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Indian patients.},

abstract = {Phenotypic variation is ubiquitous in biology and is often traceable to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression "noise," has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive "fingerprint" with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

abstract = {The molecular diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders still remains elusive in a large proportion of patients, but advances in next generation sequencing are significantly improving our chances to detect mutations even in sporadic patients. Syndromes associated with mitochondrial DNA multiple deletions are caused by different molecular defects resulting in a wide spectrum of predominantly adult-onset clinical presentations, ranging from progressive external ophthalmoplegia to multi-systemic disorders of variable severity. The mutations underlying these conditions remain undisclosed in half of the affected subjects. We applied next-generation sequencing of known mitochondrial targets (MitoExome) to probands presenting with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy and harbouring mitochondrial DNA multiple deletions in skeletal muscle. We identified autosomal recessive mutations in the DGUOK gene (encoding mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase), which has previously been associated with an infantile hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial DNA depletion. Mutations in DGUOK occurred in five independent subjects, representing 5.6% of our cohort of patients with mitochondrial DNA multiple deletions, and impaired both muscle DGUOK activity and protein stability. Clinical presentations were variable, including mitochondrial myopathy with or without progressive external ophthalmoplegia, recurrent rhabdomyolysis in a young female who had received a liver transplant at 9 months of age and adult-onset lower motor neuron syndrome with mild cognitive impairment. These findings reinforce the concept that mutations in genes involved in deoxyribonucleotide metabolism can cause diverse clinical phenotypes and suggest that DGUOK should be screened in patients harbouring mitochondrial DNA deletions in skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {During postnatal development the heart undergoes a rapid and dramatic transition to adult function through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, including alternative splicing (AS). Here we perform deep RNA-sequencing on RNA from cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts to conduct a high-resolution analysis of transcriptome changes during postnatal mouse heart development. We reveal extensive changes in gene expression and AS that occur primarily between postnatal days 1 and 28. Cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts show reciprocal regulation of gene expression reflecting differences in proliferative capacity, cell adhesion functions and mitochondrial metabolism. We further demonstrate that AS plays a role in vesicular trafficking and membrane organization. These AS transitions are enriched among targets of two RNA-binding proteins, Celf1 and Mbnl1, which undergo developmentally regulated changes in expression. Vesicular trafficking genes affected by AS during normal development (when Celf1 is downregulated) show a reversion to neonatal splicing patterns after Celf1 re-expression in adults. Short-term Celf1 induction in adult animals results in disrupted transverse tubule organization and calcium handling. These results identify potential roles for AS in multiple aspects of postnatal heart maturation, including vesicular trafficking and intracellular membrane dynamics.},

abstract = {The determination of the gene expression pattern of single cells has important implications for many areas of cellular and developmental biology including lineage determination, identification of primitive stem cells and temporal gene expression patterns induced by changes in the cellular microenvironment. Global Single Cell Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (GSC RT-PCR) enables the study of single cell gene expression patterns. Initial observations of significant heterogeneity among single cells derived from a population of cells prompted us to determine how much of this observed heterogeneity was due to the intrinsic variation within the method. In this paper we discuss the sensitivity of GSC RT-PCR for analysis of differences in gene expression between single cells and, in particular, detail the amount of variation generated by the method itself. We found that most of the intrinsic variation in the method occurred in the PCR step. The total variation induced by the method was in the range of 5 fold. While we have determined that there is a five fold methodological variation in GSC RT-PCR, any method which use its components (including generation of cDNAs for microarray analysis) is likely to be affected by such experimental variability, which could limit the interpretation of the resulting data.},

abstract = {In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), biologic risk factors such as immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (V(H)) mutation status, CD38 expression level, and genomic aberrations have recently been identified, but the relative prognostic impact of the individual parameters is unknown. In the current study, we analyzed V(H) mutation status by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing (n = 300), genomic aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (+3q, 6q-, +8q, 11q-, +12q, 13q-, t(14q), 17p-) (n = 300), and CD38 expression by triple-color FACS (CD5, CD19, CD38) (n = 157) in a unicentric CLL cohort. The prognostic influence of V(H) mutation rate and CD38 expression level was tested by maximally selected log-rank statistics. A corrected P value (P(cor)) for a cutoff level allowing the best separation of 2 subgroups with different survival probabilities was identified at 97% V(H) homology (95% confidence interval [CI], 96%-98% homology, P(cor) <.001) and at 7% CD38 expression (95% CI, 20%-71% expression, P(cor) =.02). In univariate analyses, unmutated V(H) genes and high CD38 expression levels predicted for shorter survival times. The overall incidence of genomic aberrations was similar in the V(H) unmutated and V(H) mutated subgroups. High-risk genomic aberrations such as 17p- and 11q- occurred almost exclusively in the V(H) unmutated subgroup, whereas favorable aberrations such as 13q- and 13q- as single abnormalities were overrepresented in the V(H) mutated subgroup. In multivariate analysis, unmutated V(H), 17p deletion, 11q deletion, age, WBC, and LDH were identified as independent prognostic factors, indicating a complementary role of V(H) mutation status and genomic aberrations to predict outcome in CLL.},

abstract = {RNA editing is increasingly recognized as a molecular mechanism regulating RNA activity and recoding proteins. Here we surveyed the global landscape of RNA editing in human brain tissues and identified three unique patterns of A-to-I RNA editing rates during cortical development: stable high, stable low and increasing. RNA secondary structure and the temporal expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) contribute to cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms of these RNA editing patterns, respectively. Interestingly, the increasing pattern was associated with neuronal maturation, correlated with mRNA abundance and potentially influenced miRNA binding energy. Gene ontology analyses implicated the increasing pattern in vesicle or organelle membrane-related genes and glutamate signaling pathways. We also found that the increasing pattern was selectively perturbed in spinal cord injury and glioblastoma. Our findings reveal global and dynamic aspects of RNA editing in brain, providing new insight into epitranscriptional regulation of sequence diversity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Carbamazepine causes various forms of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from maculopapular exanthema to severe blistering reactions. The HLA-B*1502 allele has been shown to be strongly correlated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN) in the Han Chinese and other Asian populations but not in European populations.

METHODS:We performed a genomewide association study of samples obtained from 22 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, 43 subjects with carbamazepine-induced maculopapular exanthema, and 3987 control subjects, all of European descent. We tested for an association between disease and HLA alleles through proxy single-nucleotide polymorphisms and imputation, confirming associations by high-resolution sequence-based HLA typing. We replicated the associations in samples from 145 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions.

RESULTS:The HLA-A*3101 allele, which has a prevalence of 2 to 5% in Northern European populations, was significantly associated with the hypersensitivity syndrome (P=3.5{\texttimes}10(-8)). An independent genomewide association study of samples from subjects with maculopapular exanthema also showed an association with the HLA-A*3101 allele (P=1.1{\texttimes}10(-6)). Follow-up genotyping confirmed the variant as a risk factor for the hypersensitivity syndrome (odds ratio, 12.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 121.03), maculopapular exanthema (odds ratio, 8.33; 95% CI, 3.59 to 19.36), and SJS-TEN (odds ratio, 25.93; 95% CI, 4.93 to 116.18).

CONCLUSIONS:The presence of the HLA-A*3101 allele was associated with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions among subjects of Northern European ancestry. The presence of the allele increased the risk from 5.0% to 26.0%, whereas its absence reduced the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%. (Funded by the U.K. Department of Health and others.).},

abstract = {Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare but severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions, which can be caused by a certain number of specific drugs among which is carbamazepine, an antiepileptic agent. A very strong association of carbamazepine-induced SJS with HLA-B*1502 has recently been described in the Han Chinese population. Here in, we report preliminary results from a European study (RegiSCAR) of 12 carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN cases (nine French and three German). Among these only four had a HLA-B*1502 allele. Remarkably, these four patients had an Asian ancestry, whereas the others did not as far as we have ascertained. This shows that although the HLA region may contain important genes for SJS, the HLA-B*1502 allele is not a universal marker for this disease and that ethnicity matters.},

First, common tools are employed to reduce primary data (sequencing reads) to a form suitable for further analyses (i.e., list of variable sites). The subsequent exploratory stage is much more ad hoc and requires development of custom scripts making it problematic for biomedical researchers. Here we describe a hybrid platform combining common analysis pathways with exploratory environments. It aims at fully encompassing and simplifying the {\textquotedblleft}raw data-to-publication{\textquotedblright} pathway and making it reproducible.},

This involves fitting a mixture distribution with two components to a test statistic estimated at each voxel in an image. The two parameters of this distribution, the proportion of nonactivated voxels, and the effect size can be estimated using maximum likelihood methods. Standard errors of the parameters can also be estimated. The fitted distribution can be used to derive brain activation maps and two examples are described, one involving a visual stimulation task, the other an auditory stimulation task. The method appears to have some advantages over direct use of the P-values corresponding to each voxel's value of the test statistic.},

abstract = {Splicing remains an incompletely understood process. Recent findings suggest that chromatin structure participates in its regulation. Here, we analyze the RNA from subcellular fractions obtained through RNA-seq in the cell line K562. We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. We introduce the coSI measure, based on RNA-seq reads mapping to exon junctions and borders, to assess the degree of splicing completion around internal exons. We show that, as expected, splicing is almost fully completed in cytosolic polyA+ RNA. In chromatin-associated RNA (which includes the RNA that is being transcribed), for 5.6% of exons, the removal of the surrounding introns is fully completed, compared with 0.3% of exons for which no intron-removal has occurred. The remaining exons exist as a mixture of spliced and fewer unspliced molecules, with a median coSI of 0.75. Thus, most RNAs undergo splicing while being transcribed: "co-transcriptional splicing." Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs. CoSI scores decrease along the gene, pointing to a "first transcribed, first spliced" rule, yet more downstream exons carry other characteristics, favoring rapid, co-transcriptional intron removal. Exons with low coSI values, that is, in the process of being spliced, are enriched with chromatin marks, consistent with a role for chromatin in splicing during transcription. For alternative exons and long noncoding RNAs, splicing tends to occur later, and the latter might remain unspliced in some cases.},

abstract = {Gene expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) allows accurate quantifications of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels over different samples. Corrective methods for different steps in the qRT-PCR reaction have been reported; however, statistical analysis and presentation of substantially variable biological repeats present problems and are often not meaningful, for example, in a biological system such as mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation. Based on a series of sequential corrections, including log transformation, mean centering, and autoscaling, we describe a robust and powerful standardization method that can be used on highly variable data sets to draw statistically reliable conclusions.},

abstract = {Annotating protein function across species is an important task that is often complicated by the presence of large paralogous gene families. Here, we report a novel strategy for identifying functionally related proteins that supplements sequence-based comparisons with information on conserved protein-protein interactions. First, the protein interaction networks of two species are aligned by assigning proteins to sequence homology clusters using the Inparanoid algorithm. Next, probabilistic inference is performed on the aligned networks to identify pairs of proteins, one from each species, that are likely to retain the same function based on conservation of their interacting partners. Applying this method to Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we analyze 121 cases for which functional orthology assignment is ambiguous when sequence similarity is used alone. In 61 of these cases, the network supports a different protein pair than that favored by sequence comparisons. These results suggest that network analysis can be used to provide a key source of information for refining sequence-based homology searches.},

abstract = {U2AF homology motifs (UHMs) mediate protein-protein interactions with U2AF ligand motifs (ULMs) of pre-mRNA splicing factors. The UHM-containing alternative splicing factor CAPER$\alpha$ regulates splicing of tumor-promoting VEGF isoforms, yet the molecular target of the CAPER$\alpha$ UHM is unknown. Here we present structures of the CAPER$\alpha$ UHM bound to a representative SF3b155 ULM at 1.7 {\AA} resolution and, for comparison, in the absence of ligand at 2.2 {\AA} resolution. The prototypical UHM/ULM interactions authenticate CAPER$\alpha$ as a bona fide member of the UHM family of proteins. We identify SF3b155 as the relevant ULM-containing partner of full-length CAPER$\alpha$ in human cell extracts. Isothermal titration calorimetry comparisons of the purified CAPER$\alpha$ UHM binding known ULM-containing proteins demonstrate that high affinity interactions depend on the presence of an intact, intrinsically unstructured SF3b155 domain containing seven ULM-like motifs. The interplay among bound CAPER$\alpha$ molecules gives rise to the appearance of two high affinity sites in the SF3b155 ULM-containing domain. In conjunction with the previously identified, UHM/ULM-mediated complexes of U2AF(65) and SPF45 with SF3b155, this work demonstrates the capacity of SF3b155 to offer a platform for coordinated recruitment of UHM-containing splicing factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:With the fast advances in nextgen sequencing technology, high-throughput RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful and cost-effective way for transcriptome study. De novo assembly of transcripts provides an important solution to transcriptome analysis for organisms with no reference genome. However, there lacked understanding on how the different variables affected assembly outcomes, and there was no consensus on how to approach an optimal solution by selecting software tool and suitable strategy based on the properties of RNA-Seq data.

RESULTS:To reveal the performance of different programs for transcriptome assembly, this work analyzed some important factors, including k-mer values, genome complexity, coverage depth, directional reads, etc. Seven program conditions, four single k-mer assemblers (SK: SOAPdenovo, ABySS, Oases and Trinity) and three multiple k-mer methods (MK: SOAPdenovo-MK, trans-ABySS and Oases-MK) were tested. While small and large k-mer values performed better for reconstructing lowly and highly expressed transcripts, respectively, MK strategy worked well for almost all ranges of expression quintiles. Among SK tools, Trinity performed well across various conditions but took the longest running time. Oases consumed the most memory whereas SOAPdenovo required the shortest runtime but worked poorly to reconstruct full-length CDS. ABySS showed some good balance between resource usage and quality of assemblies.

CONCLUSIONS:Our work compared the performance of publicly available transcriptome assemblers, and analyzed important factors affecting de novo assembly. Some practical guidelines for transcript reconstruction from short-read RNA-Seq data were proposed. De novo assembly of C. sinensis transcriptome was greatly improved using some optimized methods.},

p.21 - DUF = Domain of Unknown Function

p.23 - Example of similar sequence, dissimilar structure

p.25 - PDB has structures that people study, so only things that people really know about are in there

p.26 - 2.5: Common drug targets, so their representation in the PDB is enriched in comparison to the human genome, as many drug companies will deposit this protein with various different ligands into the PDB.

p.27 - Power law. Very small number of folds that have many functions

p.34 - Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad very powerful and highly conserved but in these two examples, evolved from different original sequences (convergent evolution)

p.35 - New fold had the same kinase fold but no longer had enzymatic function

p.36 - BLASTclust uses sequences to cluster structures

There are lots of efforts around the world to create non-redundant sets.},

Here we show that there is a strong association in Han Chinese between a genetic marker, the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by carbamazepine, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of seizures. It should be possible to exploit this association in a highly reliable test to predict severe adverse reaction, as well as for investigation of the pathogenesis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence shows that many protein complexes are conserved in evolution. Here we use conservation to find complexes that are common to the yeast S. cerevisiae and the bacteria H. pylori. Our analysis combines protein interaction data that are available for each of the two species and orthology information based on protein sequence comparison. We develop a detailed probabilistic model for protein complexes in a single species and a model for the conservation of complexes between two species. Using these models, one can recast the question of finding conserved complexes as a problem of searching for heavy subgraphs in an edge- and node-weighted graph, whose nodes are orthologous protein pairs. We tested this approach on the data currently available for yeast and bacteria and detected 11 significantly conserved complexes. Several of these complexes match very well with prior experimental knowledge on complexes in yeast only and serve for validation of our methodology. The complexes suggest new functions for a variety of uncharacterized proteins. By identifying a conserved complex whose yeast proteins function predominantly in the nuclear pore complex, we propose that the corresponding bacterial proteins function as a coherent cellular membrane transport system. We also compare our results to two alternative methods for detecting complexes and demonstrate that our methodology obtains a much higher specificity.},

The sequence of the bound peptide is AIMPARFYPK, while that of the corresponding natural peptide is LIMPARFYPK. The peptide does not make efficient use of the middle E pocket for binding, which leads to a rather superficial and exposed binding mode for the central peptide residues. Despite this, the peptide binds with high affinity (IC50 of 31 nM).},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) constitute the most fundamental type of genetic variation in human populations. About 75 000 of these reported variations cause an amino acid change in the translated protein. An important goal in genomic research is to understand how this variability affects protein function, and whether or not particular SNPs are associated to disease susceptibility. Accordingly, the SNPeffect database uses sequence- and structure-based bioinformatics tools to predict the effect of non-synonymous SNPs on the molecular phenotype of proteins. SNPeffect analyses the effect of SNPs on three categories of functional properties: (1) structural and thermodynamic properties affecting protein dynamics and stability (2) the integrity of functional and binding sites and (3) changes in posttranslational processing and cellular localization of proteins. The search interface of the database can be used to search specifically for polymorphisms that are predicted to cause a change in one of these properties. Now based on the Ensembl human databases, the SNPeffect database has been remodeled to better fit an automatically updatable structure. The current edition holds the molecular phenotype of 74 567 nsSNPs in 23 426 proteins. AVAILABILITY: SNPeffect can be accessed through http://snpeffect.vib.be.},

Using this approach we show that the protein-protein interaction networks of two distantly related species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Helicobacter pylori, harbor a large complement of evolutionarily conserved pathways, and that a large number of pathways appears to have duplicated and specialized within yeast. Analysis of these findings reveals many well characterized interaction pathways as well as many unanticipated pathways, the significance of which is reinforced by their presence in the networks of both species.},

abstract = {In the last two years the Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org) has undergone a substantial reorganisation to reduce the effort involved in making a release, thereby permitting more frequent releases. Arguably the most significant of these changes is that Pfam is now primarily based on the UniProtKB reference proteomes, with the counts of matched sequences and species reported on the website restricted to this smaller set. Building families on reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the website, whilst still providing access to many important model organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however, still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB sequences can still be retrieved. Some Pfam entries (1.6%) which have no matches to reference proteomes remain; we are working with UniProt to see if sequences from them can be incorporated into reference proteomes. Pfam-B, the automatically-generated supplement to Pfam, has been removed. The current release (Pfam 29.0) includes 16 295 entries and 559 clans. The facility to view the relationship between families within a clan has been improved by the introduction of a new tool.},

abstract = {The proteins encoded by the classical HLA class I and class II genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are highly polymorphic and are essential in self versus non-self immune recognition. HLA variation is a crucial determinant of transplant rejection and susceptibility to a large number of infectious and autoimmune diseases. Yet identification of causal variants is problematic owing to linkage disequilibrium that extends across multiple HLA and non-HLA genes in the MHC. We therefore set out to characterize the linkage disequilibrium patterns between the highly polymorphic HLA genes and background variation by typing the classical HLA genes and >7,500 common SNPs and deletion-insertion polymorphisms across four population samples. The analysis provides informative tag SNPs that capture much of the common variation in the MHC region and that could be used in disease association studies, and it provides new insight into the evolutionary dynamics and ancestral origins of the HLA loci and their haplotypes.},

But have you ever felt like the bet- ter you try to eat, the more expensive it becomes? Like the world is conspiring against you just a little bit to make it hard- er and pricier to eat well?I have had that experience for much of my life. I grew up with just my mom, and although she always provided eve- rything we really needed, we never had much money.And when I got to college and then grad- uate school, it was the same story. I wasalways trying to lose weight, but I would end up eating pizza or burgers as often as anything else, because they were really cheap. Eating healthy seemed like it was just too expensive.When I decided to go Paleo, I had a bit more of an income, but even so, I couldn{\textquoteright}t always bring myself to buy foods that I viewed as too expensive. Fortunately, I never gave up, and after being Paleo for about 9 years now, I realize that it{\textquoteright}s a myth that you need to be rich to be Paleo.Everyone will tell you that Paleo is too ex- pensive, but those people have never re- ally taken the time to figure out just how affordable Paleo can be.I{\textquoteright}ve founded two magazines that help thousands of people every month to get healthier, lose weight, and actually save money in the process, because I know that it{\textquoteright}s not only possible, but necessary.If you are in the position of spending too much money on eating a healthy Paleo diet, then there{\textquoteright}s good news and not- quite-as-good news. First of all, you can eat amazingly well and spend very little money doing so. But...you have to be diligent. Nobody is trying to help you save money - certainly not supermarkets or food manufacturers - so you{\textquoteright}ve got to look out for yourself.If you{\textquoteright}re willing to do that, then here are 31 Proven Ways to Spend Way Less Mon- ey on a Paleo Diet...}},

abstract = {A new algorithm is reported which builds an alignment between two protein structures. The algorithm involves a combinatorial extension (CE) of an alignment path defined by aligned fragment pairs (AFPs) rather than the more conventional techniques using dynamic programming and Monte Carlo optimization. AFPs, as the name suggests, are pairs of fragments, one from each protein, which confer structure similarity. AFPs are based on local geometry, rather than global features such as orientation of secondary structures and overall topology. Combinations of AFPs that represent possible continuous alignment paths are selectively extended or discarded thereby leading to a single optimal alignment. The algorithm is fast and accurate in finding an optimal structure alignment and hence suitable for database scanning and detailed analysis of large protein families. The method has been tested and compared with results from Dali and VAST using a representative sample of similar structures. Several new structural similarities not detected by these other methods are reported. Specific one-on-one alignments and searches against all structures as found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) can be performed via the Web at http://cl.sdsc.edu/ce.html.},

abstract = {Clonal expansions of CD8+ T cells have been identified in muscle and blood of polymyositis patients by PCR techniques, including T cell receptor (TCR) complementarity-determining region (CDR)3 length analysis (spectratyping). To examine a possible pathogenic role of these clonally expanded T cells, we combined CDR3 spectratyping with laser microdissection and single-cell PCR of individual myocytotoxic T cells that contact, invade, and destroy a skeletal muscle fiber. First, we screened cDNA from muscle biopsy specimens by CDR3 spectratyping for expanded TCR beta chain variable region (BV) sequences. To pinpoint the corresponding T cells in tissue, we stained cryostat sections with appropriate anti-TCR BV mAbs, isolated single BV+ T cells that directly contacted or invaded a muscle fiber by laser-assisted microdissection, and amplified their TCR BV chain sequences from rearranged genomic DNA. In this way, we could relate the oligoclonal peaks identified by CDR3-spectratype screening to morphologically characterized microdissected T cells. In one patient, a large fraction of the microdissected T cells carried a common TCR-BV amino acid CDR3 motif and conservative nucleotide exchanges in the CDR3 region, suggesting an antigen-driven response. In several cases, we tracked these T cell clones for several years in CD8+ (but not CD4+) blood lymphocytes and in two patients also in consecutive muscle biopsy specimens. During immunosuppressive therapy, oligoclonal CDR3-spectratype patterns tended to revert to more polyclonal Gaussian distribution-like patterns. Our findings demonstrate that CDR3 spectratyping and single-cell analysis can be combined to identify and track autoaggressive T cell clones in blood and target tissue. This approach should be applicable to other inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.},

The reduction in ATP induced by sodium arsenite was possibly through mitochondrial damage, since treatment with sodium arsenite resulted in reduction of rhodamine 123 accumulation and disruption of the structure of the cristae in mitochondria. However, all of these changes could be reversed by removing sodium arsenite from the culture medium. The levels of ATP depletion were correlated with the killing effects of sodium arsenite in HeLa S-3 cells.},

abstract = {Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, in which genomically encoded adenosine is changed to inosine in RNA, is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). This fine-tuning mechanism is critical during normal development and diseases, particularly in relation to brain functions. A-to-I RNA editing has also been hypothesized to be a driving force in human brain evolution. A large number of RNA editing sites have recently been identified, mostly as a result of the development of deep sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. Deciphering the functional consequences of RNA editing events is challenging, but emerging genome engineering approaches may expedite new discoveries. To understand how RNA editing is dynamically regulated, it is imperative to construct a spatiotemporal atlas at the species, tissue and cell levels. Future studies will need to identify the cis and trans regulatory factors that drive the selectivity and frequency of RNA editing. We anticipate that recent technological advancements will aid researchers in acquiring a much deeper understanding of the functions and regulation of RNA editing.},

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The study of complex biological networks and prediction of gene function has been enabled by high-throughput (HTP) methods for detection of genetic and protein interactions. Sparse coverage in HTP datasets may, however, distort network properties and confound predictions. Although a vast number of well substantiated interactions are recorded in the scientific literature, these data have not yet been distilled into networks that enable system-level inference.

RESULTS:We describe here a comprehensive database of genetic and protein interactions, and associated experimental evidence, for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as manually curated from over 31,793 abstracts and online publications. This literature-curated (LC) dataset contains 33,311 interactions, on the order of all extant HTP datasets combined. Surprisingly, HTP protein-interaction datasets currently achieve only around 14% coverage of the interactions in the literature. The LC network nevertheless shares attributes with HTP networks, including scale-free connectivity and correlations between interactions, abundance, localization, and expression. We find that essential genes or proteins are enriched for interactions with other essential genes or proteins, suggesting that the global network may be functionally unified. This interconnectivity is supported by a substantial overlap of protein and genetic interactions in the LC dataset. We show that the LC dataset considerably improves the predictive power of network-analysis approaches. The full LC dataset is available at the BioGRID (http://www.thebiogrid.org) and SGD (http://www.yeastgenome.org/) databases.

CONCLUSION:Comprehensive datasets of biological interactions derived from the primary literature provide critical benchmarks for HTP methods, augment functional prediction, and reveal system-level attributes of biological networks.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS), in higher eukaryotes, is one of the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation that generate multiple transcripts from the same gene. One particular mode of AS is the skipping event where an exon may be alternatively excluded or constitutively included in the resulting mature mRNA. Both transcript isoforms from this skipping event site, i.e. in which the exon is either included (inclusion isoform) or excluded (skipping isoform), are typically present in one cell, and maintain a subtle balance that is vital to cellular function and dynamics. However, how the prevailing conditions dictate which isoform is expressed and what biological factors might influence the regulation of this process remain areas requiring further exploration. In this study, we have developed a novel computational method, graph-based exon-skipping scanner (GESS), for de novo detection of skipping event sites from raw RNA-seq reads without prior knowledge of gene annotations, as well as for determining the dominant isoform generated from such sites. We have applied our method to publicly available RNA-seq data in GM12878 and K562 cells from the ENCODE consortium and experimentally validated several skipping site predictions by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we integrated other sequencing-based genomic data to investigate the impact of splicing activities, transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic histone modifications on splicing outcomes. Our computational analysis found that splice sites within the skipping-isoform-dominated group (SIDG) tended to exhibit weaker MaxEntScan-calculated splice site strength around middle, 'skipping', exons compared to those in the inclusion-isoform-dominated group (IIDG). We further showed the positional preference pattern of splicing factors, characterized by enrichment in the intronic splice sites immediately bordering middle exons. Finally, our analysis suggested that different epigenetic factors may introduce a variable obstacle in the process of exon-intron boundary establishment leading to skipping events.},

abstract = {Heregulins bind directly to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors, leading to multiple dimerization possibilities including heterodimerization with the ErbB2 receptor. We have generated ErbB3-, ErbB2- and heregulin-deficient mice to assess their roles in development and differentiation. Heregulin(-/-) and ErbB2(-/-) embryos died on E10.5 due to a lack of cardiac ventricular myocyte differentiation; ErbB3(-/-) embryos survived until E13.5 exhibiting cardiac cushion abnormalities leading to blood reflux through defective valves. In ErbB3(-/-) embryos, the midbrain/hindbrain region was strikingly affected, with little differentiation of the cerebellar plate. Cranial ganglia defects, while present in all three nulls, were less severe in ErbB3(-/-) embryos. The cranial ganglia defects, along with a dramatic reduction in Schwann cells, enteric ganglia and adrenal chromaffin cells, suggests a generalized effect on the neural crest. Numerous organs, including the stomach and pancreas also exhibited anomalous development.},

abstract = {Analysis of single molecules in living cells has provided quantitative insights into the kinetics of fundamental biological processes; however, the dynamics of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation have yet to be addressed. We have developed a fluorescence microscopy technique that reports on the first translation events of individual mRNA molecules. This allowed us to examine the spatiotemporal regulation of translation during normal growth and stress and during Drosophila oocyte development. We have shown that mRNAs are not translated in the nucleus but translate within minutes after export, that sequestration within P-bodies regulates translation, and that oskar mRNA is not translated until it reaches the posterior pole of the oocyte. This methodology provides a framework for studying initiation of protein synthesis on single mRNAs in living cells.},

abstract = {A single cardiac troponin T gene generates two mRNA products by developmentally regulated alternate splicing. Nucleotide sequence of the entire 18 exon gene and both representative cDNAs demonstrate that the two mRNAs differ by the presence or absence of a single internal coding exon. Both mRNA products appear to be generated from a single primary transcript; however, one mRNA splice product predominates in early embryonic cardiac muscle while the other vastly predominates in adult cardiac muscle. The corresponding embryonic and adult cardiac troponin T proteins differ by the inclusion or exclusion, respectively, of an internal, highly acidic 10 amino acids near the amino terminus. Unusual features of the variable peptide region and its restriction to embryonic stages suggest that it might play a specialized role during sarcomere assembly in embryonic striated muscle. In addition to developmental regulation of RNA processing, the cardiac troponin T gene also demonstrates complex tissue-specific expression. We have previously shown that this single cardiac troponin gene is regulated according to two different and tissue-specific regulatory programs. Here we demonstrate that a single promoter is utilized for both expression patterns. The cardiac troponin T gene also has several interesting structural features including a pseudoexon and an exon only six nucleotides in length. The size of this exon establishes a new lower limit for the number of nucleotides that can be recognized as an exonic sequence.},

abstract = {Cell proliferation only proceeds when metabolism is capable of providing a budget of metabolic intermediates that is adequate to ensure both energy regeneration and the synthesis of cell building blocks in sufficient amounts. In tumor cells, the glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2, M2-PK) determines whether glucose is converted to lactate for regeneration of energy (active tetrameric form, Warburg effect) or used for the synthesis of cell building blocks (nearly inactive dimeric form). This review discusses the regulation mechanisms of pyruvate kinase M2 expression by different transcription factors as well as the regulation of pyruvate kinase M2 activity by direct interaction with certain oncoproteins, tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, binding of phosphotyrosine peptides, association with other glycolytic and non glycolytic enzymes, the promyelocytic leukemia tumor suppressor protein, as well as metabolic intermediates. An intervention in the regulation mechanisms of the expression, activity and tetramer to dimer ratio of pyruvate kinase M2 has severe consequences for metabolism as well as proliferation and tumorigenic capacity of the cells which makes this enzyme a promising target for potential therapeutic approaches. The quantification of the dimeric form of pyruvate kinase M2 (Tumor M2-PK) in plasma and stool allows early detection of tumors and therapy control. Several different mechanisms may induce a translocation of pyruvate kinase M2 into the nucleus. The role of pyruvate kinase M2 in the nucleus is complex as witnessed by evidence of its effect both as pro-proliferative as well as pro-apoptotic stimuli.},

A-to-I RNA editing is particularly widespread in the brain and is known to play important roles in neuronal functions. In this study we investigated RNA-editing changes during human brain development and maturation, as well as evolutionary conservation of RNA-editing patterns across primates. We used high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to quantify the RNA-editing levels and assess ontogenetic dynamics of RNA editing at more than 8000 previously annotated exonic A-to-I RNA-editing sites in two brain regions--prefrontal cortex and cerebellum--of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We observed substantial conservation of RNA-editing levels between the brain regions, as well as among the three primate species. Evolutionary changes in RNA editing were nonetheless evident, with 40% of the annotated editing sites studied showing divergent editing levels among the three species and 16.5% of sites displaying statistically significant human-specific editing patterns. Across lifespan, we observed an increase of the RNA-editing level with advanced age in both brain regions of all three primate species.},

abstract = {Cell-cycle control of transcription seems to be a universal feature of proliferating cells, although relatively little is known about its biological significance and conservation between organisms. The two distantly related yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe have provided valuable complementary insight into the regulation of periodic transcription as a function of the cell cycle. More recently, genome-wide studies of proliferating cells have identified hundreds of periodically expressed genes and underlying mechanisms of transcriptional control. This review discusses the regulation of three major transcriptional waves, which roughly coincide with three main cell-cycle transitions (initiation of DNA replication, entry into mitosis, and exit from mitosis). I also compare and contrast the transcriptional regulatory networks between the two yeasts and discuss the evolutionary conservation and possible roles for cell cycle-regulated transcription.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is the major source of proteome diversity in humans and thus is highly relevant to disease and therapy. For example, recent work suggests that the long-sought-after target of the analgesic acetaminophen is a neural-specific, alternatively spliced isoform of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1). Several important diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, have been linked with mutations or variations in either cis-acting elements or trans-acting factors that lead to aberrant splicing and abnormal protein production. Correction of erroneous splicing is thus an important goal of molecular therapies. Recent experiments have used modified oligonucleotides to inhibit cryptic exons or to activate exons weakened by mutations, suggesting that these reagents could eventually lead to effective therapies.},

abstract = {Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are initially classified by serotyping but recently can be re-grouped by their peptide-presentation characteristics into supertypes. Both HLA-A*0301 and HLA-A*1101 are grouped into A3 supertype. Although a number of cross-presented T cell epitopes of HLA-A*0301 and HLA-A*1101 have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of cross-presentation remain elusive. Herein, the structures of HLA-A*0301 with two HIV-derived immunodominant T cell epitopes were solved and their characteristics in comparison with HLA-A*1101 presenting the same peptides were analyzed. The comparable structures of HLA-A*0301 and HLA-A*1101 with subtle differences illustrate the common modes of cross-presented peptides and the strict HLA-restriction of T cell receptor (TCR)-recognition.},

We studied 12 genetic loci and estimate that the probability of amplifying any sequence in the genome to a minimum of 30 copies is not less than 0.78 (95% confidence). Whole genome amplification beginning with a single cell, or other samples with very small amounts of DNA, has significant implications for multipoint mapping by sperm or oocyte typing and possibly for genetic disease diagnosis, forensics, and the analysis of ancient DNA samples.},

E. Backskin, % of Sox9 or K15 cells that stained positive for TUNEL, apoptosis marker in catagen phase of hair follicle growth.
F. Tailskin, Amount of apoptotic CP3+ apoptotic cells
G. Knockout cells had far less CP3+ cells after STS (staurosporine) or ETO (etoposide) treatment that's supposed to induce apoptosis.

Figure 2.
A,B. Knockouts had increased wound healing (coverage of the wound) at both 8 and 15 weeks of age, days = days post wound infliction.
C. See hairs growing in the knockouts, mostly looking okay but somewhat hyperplastic. No hair growth in WT.
D-H. Immunofluorescence of various HFSC markers in teh mouse wound. HFSCs in knockouts keep proliferating after the wild type ones had become quiescent.

Figure 3.
A-H. Cre-recombinant mice would mark HFCs with YFP at that timepoint. More HFSC and HFSC-derived cells in knockout, wounded mice. HFSC remained in epidermis at 2 months

The browser provides a comparative view between the NCBI human reference sequence and the HuRef assembly, and it enables the navigation of the HuRef genome in the context of HuRef, NCBI and Ensembl annotations. Single nucleotide polymorphisms, indels, inversions, structural and copy-number variations are shown in the context of existing functional annotations on either genome in the comparative view. Demonstrated here are some potential uses of the browser to enable a better understanding of individual human genetic variation. The browser provides full access to the underlying reads with sequence and quality information, the genome assembly and the evidence supporting the identification of DNA polymorphisms. The HuRef Browser is a unique and versatile tool for browsing genome assemblies and studying individual human sequence variation in a diploid context. The browser is available online at http://huref.jcvi.org.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Arsenic is a nonmutagenic carcinogen affecting millions of people. The cellular impact of this metalloid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined by profiling global gene expression and sensitivity phenotypes. These data were then mapped to a metabolic network composed of all known biochemical reactions in yeast, as well as the yeast network of 20,985 protein-protein/protein-DNA interactions.

RESULTS:While the expression data unveiled no significant nodes in the metabolic network, the regulatory network revealed several important nodes as centers of arsenic-induced activity. The highest-scoring proteins included Fhl1, Msn2, Msn4, Yap1, Cad1 (Yap2), Pre1, Hsf1 and Met31. Contrary to the gene-expression analyses, the phenotypic-profiling data mapped to the metabolic network. The two significant metabolic networks unveiled were shikimate, and serine, threonine and glutamate biosynthesis. We also carried out transcriptional profiling of specific deletion strains, confirming that the transcription factors Yap1, Arr1 (Yap8), and Rpn4 strongly mediate the cell's adaptation to arsenic-induced stress but that Cad1 has negligible impact.

CONCLUSIONS:By integrating phenotypic and transcriptional profiling and mapping the data onto the metabolic and regulatory networks, we have shown that arsenic is likely to channel sulfur into glutathione for detoxification, leads to indirect oxidative stress by depleting glutathione pools, and alters protein turnover via arsenation of sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Furthermore, we show that phenotypically sensitive pathways are upstream of differentially expressed ones, indicating that transcriptional and phenotypic profiling implicate distinct, but related, pathways.},

A multitude of RNA-binding proteins as well as a host of associated proteins participate in the fate of mRNA from transcription and processing in the nucleus to translation and decay in the cytoplasm. Methodological innovations in cell biology and genome-wide high-throughput approaches have revealed an unexpected diversity of mRNA-associated proteins and unforeseen interconnections between mRNA-processing steps. Recent insights into mRNP formation in vivo have also highlighted the importance of mRNP packaging, which can sort RNAs on the basis of their length and determine mRNA fate through alternative mRNP assembly, processing and export pathways.},

abstract = {As an operational definition, we refer to regions in proteins that do not adopt regular three-dimensional structures in isolation, as disordered regions. An antipode to disorder would be 'well-structured' rather than 'ordered'. Here, we argue for the following three hypotheses. Firstly, it is more useful to picture disorder as a distinct phenomenon in structural biology than as an extreme example of protein flexibility. Secondly, there are many very different flavors of protein disorder, nevertheless, it seems advantageous to portray the universe of all possible proteins in terms of two main types: well-structured, disordered. There might be a third type 'other' but we have so far no positive evidence for this. Thirdly, nature uses protein disorder as a tool to adapt to different environments. Protein disorder is evolutionarily conserved and this maintenance of disorder is highly nontrivial. Increasingly integrating protein disorder into the toolbox of a living cell was a crucial step in the evolution from simple bacteria to complex eukaryotes. We need new advanced computational methods to study this new milestone in the advance of protein biology.},

Here we describe single-cell gene expression profiling of CA1 neurons in the rat hippocampus using a combination of laser capture, T7 RNA amplification, and cDNA microarray analysis. Subsequent cluster analysis of the microarray data identified two different cell types: pyramidal neurons and an interneuron. Cluster analysis also revealed differences among the pyramidal neurons, indicating that even a single cell type in vivo is not a homogeneous population of cells at the gene expression level. Microarray data were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. We also report on the reproducibility and sensitivity of this combination of methods. Single-cell gene expression profiling offers a powerful tool to tackle the complexity of the mammalian brain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:ADAR enzymes convert adenosines to inosines within double-stranded RNAs, including microRNA (miRNA) precursors, with important consequences on miRNA retargeting and expression. ADAR2 activity is impaired in glioblastoma and its rescue has anti-tumoral effects. However, how ADAR2 activity may impact the miRNome and the progression of glioblastoma is not known.

RESULTS:By integrating deep-sequencing and array approaches with bioinformatics analyses and molecular studies, we show that ADAR2 is essential to edit a small number of mature miRNAs and to significantly modulate the expression of about 90 miRNAs in glioblastoma cells. Specifically, the rescue of ADAR2 activity in cancer cells recovers the edited miRNA population lost in glioblastoma cell lines and tissues, and rebalances expression of onco-miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs to the levels observed in normal human brain. We report that the major effect of ADAR2 is to reduce the expression of a large number of miRNAs, most of which act as onco-miRNAs. ADAR2 can edit miR-222/221 and miR-21 precursors and decrease the expression of the corresponding mature onco-miRNAs in vivo and in vitro, with important effects on cell proliferation and migration.

CONCLUSIONS:Our findings disclose an additional layer of complexity in miRNome regulation and provide information to better understand the impact of ADAR2 editing enzyme in glioblastoma. We propose that ADAR2 is a key factor for maintaining edited-miRNA population and balancing the expression of several essential miRNAs involved in cancer.},

METHODS:We have genotyped the HLA-B alleles in 56 Caucasian patients with varying severities of CBZ hypersensitivity and 43 controls on CBZ without adverse effects.

RESULTS:None of our patients (including two with blistering skin rashes) were positive for the HLA-B*1502 allele. HLA-B*0702 allele may protect against severe CBZ hypersensitivity but warrants further study. Of secondary interest, the correlation between HLA-B*0801 and HLA-DR3, DQ2 and TNF -308 alleles (on the ancestral haplotype 8.1) is consistent with our previous findings.

CONCLUSION:HLA-B*1502 does not seem to be a marker for all forms of CBZ-induced hypersensitivity in a Caucasian population.},

We apply our methodology to search for protein pathways in the yeast protein-protein interaction network. We demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of reconstructing known signaling pathways and identifying functionally enriched paths and trees in an unsupervised manner. The algorithm is very efficient, computing optimal paths of length 8 within minutes and paths of length 10 in about three hours.},

abstract = {HLA-A*1101 is one of the most common human class I alleles worldwide. An increased frequency of HLA-A*1101 has been observed in cohorts of female sex workers from Northern Thailand who are highly exposed to HIV-1 and yet have remained persistently seronegative. In view of this apparent association of HLA-A*1101 with resistance to acquisition of HIV-1 infection, and given the importance of eliciting strong CTL responses to control and eliminate HIV-1, we have determined the crystal structure of HLA-A*1101 complexed with two immunodominant HIV-1 CTL epitopes: the nonamer reverse transcriptase(313-321) (AIFQSSMTK) and decamer Nef(73-82) (QVPLRPMTYK) peptides. The structures confirm the presence of primary anchor residues P2-Ile/-Val and P9-/P10-Lys, and also clearly reveal the presence of secondary anchor residues P6-Ser for reverse transcriptase and P7-Met for Nef. The overall backbone conformation of both peptides is defined as two bulges that are separated by a more buried middle residue. In this study, we discuss how this topology may offer functional advantages in the selection and presentation of HIV-1 CTL epitopes by HLA-A*1101. Overall, this structural analysis permits a more accurate definition of the peptide-binding motif of HLA-A*1101, the characterization of its antigenic surface, and the correlation of molecular determinants with resistance to HIV-1 infection. These studies are relevant for the rational design of HLA-A*1101-restricted CTL epitopes with improved binding and immunological properties for the development of HIV-1 vaccines.},

abstract = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86% with a minor isoform frequency of 15% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:ADAR enzymes convert adenosines to inosines within double-stranded RNAs, including microRNA (miRNA) precursors, with important consequences on miRNA retargeting and expression. ADAR2 activity is impaired in glioblastoma and its rescue has anti-tumoral effects. However, how ADAR2 activity may impact the miRNome and the progression of glioblastoma is not known.

RESULTS:By integrating deep-sequencing and array approaches with bioinformatics analyses and molecular studies, we show that ADAR2 is essential to edit a small number of mature miRNAs and to significantly modulate the expression of about 90 miRNAs in glioblastoma cells. Specifically, the rescue of ADAR2 activity in cancer cells recovers the edited miRNA population lost in glioblastoma cell lines and tissues, and rebalances expression of onco-miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs to the levels observed in normal human brain. We report that the major effect of ADAR2 is to reduce the expression of a large number of miRNAs, most of which act as onco-miRNAs. ADAR2 can edit miR-222/221 and miR-21 precursors and decrease the expression of the corresponding mature onco-miRNAs in vivo and in vitro, with important effects on cell proliferation and migration.

CONCLUSIONS:Our findings disclose an additional layer of complexity in miRNome regulation and provide information to better understand the impact of ADAR2 editing enzyme in glioblastoma. We propose that ADAR2 is a key factor for maintaining edited-miRNA population and balancing the expression of several essential miRNAs involved in cancer.},

abstract = {RBFOX2 (RNA-binding protein, Fox-1 homologue 2)/RBM9 (RNA-binding-motif protein 9)/RTA (repressor of tamoxifen action)/HNRBP2 (hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 2) encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in tissue specific alternative splicing regulation and steroid receptors transcriptional activity. Its ability to regulate specific splicing profiles depending on context has been related to different expression levels of the RBFOX2 protein itself and that of other splicing regulatory proteins involved in the shared modulation of specific genes splicing. However, this cannot be the sole explanation as to why RBFOX2 plays a widespread role in numerous cellular mechanisms from development to cell survival dependent on cell/tissue type. RBFOX2 isoforms with altered protein domains exist. In the present article, we describe the main RBFOX2 protein domains, their importance in the context of splicing and transcriptional regulation and we propose that RBFOX2 isoform distribution may play a fundamental role in RBFOX2-specific cellular effects.},

abstract = {Although the lifelong addition of new neurons to the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus of mammalian brains is by now an accepted fact, the function of adult-generated neurons still largely remains a mystery. The ability of new neurons to form synapses with preexisting neurons without disrupting circuit function is central to the hypothesized role of adult neurogenesis as a substrate for learning and memory. With the development of several new genetic labeling and imaging techniques, the study of synapse development and integration of these new neurons into mature circuits both in vitro and in vivo is rapidly advancing our insight into their structural plasticity. Investigators' observation of synaptogenesis occurring in the adult brain is beginning to shed light on the flexibility that adult neurogenesis offers to mature circuits and the potential contribution of the transient plasticity that new neurons provide toward circuit refinement and adaptation to changing environmental demands.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

abstract = {The structure of the human MHC-I molecule HLA-A*1101 in complex with a nonameric peptide (KTFPPTEPK) has been determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.45 A resolution. The peptide is derived from the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein positions 362-370 (SNP362-370). It is conserved in all known isolates of SARS-CoV and has been verified by in vitro peptide-binding studies to be a good to intermediate binder to HLA-A*0301 and HLA-A*1101, with IC50 values of 70 and 186 nM, respectively [Sylvester-Hvid et al. (2004), Tissue Antigens, 63, 395-400]. In terms of the residues lining the peptide-binding groove, the HLA-A*1101-SNP362-370 complex is very similar to other known structures of HLA-A*1101 and HLA-A*6801. The SNP362-370 peptide is held in place by 17 hydrogen bonds to the alpha-chain residues and by nine water molecules which are also tightly bound in the peptide-binding groove. Thr6 of the peptide (Thr6p) does not make efficient use of the middle (E) pocket. For vaccine development, there seems to be a potential for optimization targeted at this position. All residues except Thr2p and Lys9p are accessible for T-cell recognition.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Alternative splicing is central for cellular processes and substantially increases transcriptome and proteome diversity. Aberrant splicing events often have pathological consequences and are associated with various diseases and cancer types. The emergence of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides an exciting new technology to analyse alternative splicing on a large scale. However, algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative splicing from short-read sequencing are not fully established yet and there are still no standard solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks.

RESULTS:We present a new method and software to predict genes that are differentially spliced between two different conditions using RNA-seq data. Our method uses geometric angles between the high dimensional vectors of exon read counts. With this, differential splicing can be detected even if the splicing events are composed of higher complexity and involve previously unknown splicing patterns. We applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical courses. We show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our method in the context of patient clustering. We verified our predictions by several methods including simulated experiments and complementary in silico analyses. We found a significant number of exons with specific regulatory splicing factor motifs for predicted genes and a substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative splicing. Furthermore, we could successfully exploit splicing information to cluster tissues and patients. Finally, we found additional evidence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalized read coverage plots and in reads that span exon-exon junctions.

abstract = {Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a highly variable, multi-system disorder resulting from the expansion of an untranslated CTG tract in DMPK. In DM1 expanded CUG repeat RNAs form hairpin secondary structures that bind and aberrantly sequester the RNA splice regulator, MBNL1. RNA splice defects resulting as a consequence of MBNL1 depletion have been shown to play a key role in the development of DM1 pathology. In patient populations, both the number and severity of DM1 symptoms increase broadly as a function of CTG tract length. However significant variability in the DM1 phenotype is observed in patients encoding similar CTG repeat numbers. Here we demonstrate that a gradual decrease in MBNL1 levels results both in the expansion of the repertoire of splice defects and an increase in the severity of the splice alterations. Thus, MBNL1 loss does not have an all or none outcome but rather shows a graded effect on the number and severity of the ensuing splice defects. Our results suggest that once a critical threshold is reached, relatively small dose variations of free MBNL1 levels, which may reflect modest changes in the size of the CUG tract or the extent of hairpin secondary structure formation, can significantly alter the number and severity of splice abnormalities and thus contribute to the phenotype variability observed in DM1 patients.},

abstract = {Oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) encodes for a Rho-GTPase-activating protein, important for dendritic morphogenesis and synaptic function. Mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with X-linked intellectual disability associated with cerebellar hypoplasia. ADAR enzymes are responsible for A-to-I RNA editing, an essential post-transcriptional RNA modification contributing to transcriptome and proteome diversification. Specifically, ADAR2 activity is essential for brain development and function. Herein, we show that the OPHN1 transcript undergoes post-transcriptional modifications such as A-to-I RNA editing and alternative splicing in human brain and other tissues. We found that OPHN1 editing is detectable already at the 18th week of gestation in human brain with a boost of editing at weeks 20 to 33, concomitantly with OPHN1 expression increase and the appearance of a novel OPHN1 splicing isoform. Our results demonstrate that multiple post-transcriptional events occur on OPHN1, a gene playing an important role in brain function and development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Bisulfite sequencing is a powerful technique to study DNA cytosine methylation. Bisulfite treatment followed by PCR amplification specifically converts unmethylated cytosines to thymine. Coupled with next generation sequencing technology, it is able to detect the methylation status of every cytosine in the genome. However, mapping high-throughput bisulfite reads to the reference genome remains a great challenge due to the increased searching space, reduced complexity of bisulfite sequence, asymmetric cytosine to thymine alignments, and multiple CpG heterogeneous methylation.

RESULTS:We developed an efficient bisulfite reads mapping algorithm BSMAP to address the above issues. BSMAP combines genome hashing and bitwise masking to achieve fast and accurate bisulfite mapping. Compared with existing bisulfite mapping approaches, BSMAP is faster, more sensitive and more flexible.

CONCLUSION:BSMAP is the first general-purpose bisulfite mapping software. It is able to map high-throughput bisulfite reads at whole genome level with feasible memory and CPU usage. It is freely available under GPL v3 license at http://code.google.com/p/bsmap/.},

One solution to this problem is to first amplify the entire genome, thus providing enough DNA for numerous subsequent PCRs. In this study we have investigated four different methods of whole genome amplification performed on single cells, and have identified a protocol that generates sufficient quantities of DNA for comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) as well as more than 90 independent amplification reactions. Thus, numerous specific loci and the copy number of every chromosome can be assessed in a single cell. We report here the first reliable application of CGH to single cells from human preimplantation embryos (blastomeres) and to single fibroblasts, buccal cells and amniocytes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Co-expression measures are often used to define networks among genes. Mutual information (MI) is often used as a generalized correlation measure. It is not clear how much MI adds beyond standard (robust) correlation measures or regression model based association measures. Further, it is important to assess what transformations of these and other co-expression measures lead to biologically meaningful modules (clusters of genes).

RESULTS:We provide a comprehensive comparison between mutual information and several correlation measures in 8 empirical data sets and in simulations. We also study different approaches for transforming an adjacency matrix, e.g. using the topological overlap measure. Overall, we confirm close relationships between MI and correlation in all data sets which reflects the fact that most gene pairs satisfy linear or monotonic relationships. We discuss rare situations when the two measures disagree. We also compare correlation and MI based approaches when it comes to defining co-expression network modules. We show that a robust measure of correlation (the biweight midcorrelation transformed via the topological overlap transformation) leads to modules that are superior to MI based modules and maximal information coefficient (MIC) based modules in terms of gene ontology enrichment. We present a function that relates correlation to mutual information which can be used to approximate the mutual information from the corresponding correlation coefficient. We propose the use of polynomial or spline regression models as an alternative to MI for capturing non-linear relationships between quantitative variables.

CONCLUSION:The biweight midcorrelation outperforms MI in terms of elucidating gene pairwise relationships. Coupled with the topological overlap matrix transformation, it often leads to more significantly enriched co-expression modules. Spline and polynomial networks form attractive alternatives to MI in case of non-linear relationships. Our results indicate that MI networks can safely be replaced by correlation networks when it comes to measuring co-expression relationships in stationary data.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-accuracy de novo assembly of the short sequencing reads from RNA-Seq technology is very challenging. We introduce a de novo assembly algorithm, EBARDenovo, which stands for Extension, Bridging And Repeat-sensing Denovo. This algorithm uses an efficient chimera-detection function to abrogate the effect of aberrant chimeric reads in RNA-Seq data. RESULTS: EBARDenovo resolves the complications of RNA-Seq assembly arising from sequencing errors, repetitive sequences and aberrant chimeric amplicons. In a series of assembly experiments, our algorithm is the most accurate among the examined programs, including de Bruijn graph assemblers, Trinity and Oases.Availability and implementation: EBARDenovo is available at http://ebardenovo.sourceforge.net/.

Profile HMM analyses complement standard pairwise comparison methods for large-scale sequence analysis. Several software implementations and two large libraries of profile HMMs of common protein domains are available. HMM methods performed comparably to threading methods in the CASP2 structure prediction exercise.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is one of the major mechanisms to warrant the proteomic and functional diversity of eukaryotes. However, the complex nature of the splicing machinery, its associated splicing regulators and the functional implications of alternatively spliced transcripts is only poorly understood.We investigated here the functional role of the splicing regulator rbfox1 in vivo using the zebrafish as a model system. We find that loss-of rbfox1 leads to progressive cardiac contractile dysfunction and heart failure. By using deep-transcriptome sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR we show that depletion of rbfox1 in zebrafish results in an altered isoform expression of several crucial target genes, such as actn3a and hug.This study underlines that tightly regulated splicing is necessary for unconstrained cardiac function and renders the splicing regulator rbfox1 an interesting target to be investigated in human heart failure and cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To review the evidence for an association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke, cognitive decline, dementia, and death.

DESIGN:Systematic review and meta-analysis.

DATA SOURCES:PubMed from 1966 to 23 November 2009.

STUDY SELECTION:Prospective longitudinal studies that used magnetic resonance imaging and assessed the impact of white matter hyperintensities on risk of incident stroke, cognitive decline, dementia, and death, and, for the meta-analysis, studies that provided risk estimates for a categorical measure of white matter hyperintensities, assessing the impact of these lesions on risk of stroke, dementia, and death.

DATA EXTRACTION:Population studied, duration of follow-up, method used to measure white matter hyperintensities, definition of the outcome, and measure of the association of white matter hyperintensities with the outcome.

DATA SYNTHESIS:46 longitudinal studies evaluated the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke (n=12), cognitive decline (n=19), dementia (n=17), and death (n=10). 22 studies could be included in a meta-analysis (nine of stroke, nine of dementia, eight of death). White matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 4.4), dementia (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8), and death (2.0, 1.6 to 2.7). An association of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline in global cognitive performance, executive function, and processing speed was also suggested.

CONCLUSION:White matter hyperintensities predict an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death. Therefore white matter hyperintensities indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events when identified as part of diagnostic investigations, and support their use as an intermediate marker in a research setting. Their discovery should prompt detailed screening for risk factors of stroke and dementia.},

abstract = {DDX6 (p54/RCK) is a human RNA helicase with central roles in mRNA decay and translation repression. To help our understanding of how DDX6 performs these multiple functions, we conducted the first unbiased, large-scale study to map the DDX6-centric protein-protein interactome using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Using DDX6 as bait, we identify a high-confidence and high-quality set of protein interaction partners which are enriched for functions in RNA metabolism and ribosomal proteins. The screen is highly specific, maximizing the number of true positives, as demonstrated by the validation of 81% (47/58) of the RNA-independent interactors through known functions and interactions. Importantly, we minimize the number of indirect interaction partners through use of a nuclease-based digestion to eliminate RNA. We describe eleven new interactors, including proteins involved in splicing which is an as-yet unknown role for DDX6. We validated and characterized in more detail the },

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Discovery of precise specificity of transcription factors is an important step on the way to understanding the complex mechanisms of gene regulation in eukaryotes. Recently, double-stranded protein-binding microarrays were developed as a potentially scalable approach to tackle transcription factor binding site identification.

RESULTS:Here we present an algorithmic approach to experimental design of a microarray that allows for testing full specificity of a transcription factor binding to all possible DNA binding sites of a given length, with optimally efficient use of the array. This design is universal, works for any factor that binds a sequence motif and is not species-specific. Furthermore, simulation results show that data produced with the designed arrays is easier to analyze and would result in more precise identification of binding sites.

CONCLUSION:In this study, we present a design of a double stranded DNA microarray for protein-DNA interaction studies and show that our algorithm allows optimally efficient use of the arrays for this purpose. We believe such a design will prove useful for transcription factor binding site identification and other biological problems.},

abstract = {Methods suggested for reconstructing regulatory networks can be divided into two sets based on how the activity level of transcription factors (TFs) is inferred. The first group of methods relies on the expression levels of TFs, assuming that the activity of a TF is highly correlated with its mRNA abundance. The second treats the activity level as unobserved and infers it from the expression of the genes that the TF regulates. While both types of methods were successfully applied, each suffers from drawbacks that limit their accuracy. For the first set, the assumption that mRNA levels are correlated with activity is violated for many TFs due to post-transcriptional modifications. For the second, the expression level of a TF which might be informative is completely ignored. Here we present the post-transcriptional modification model (PTMM) that, unlike previous methods, utilizes both sources of data concurrently. Our method uses a switching model to determine whether a TF is transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally regulated. This model is combined with a factorial HMM to reconstruct the interactions in a dynamic regulatory network. Using simulated and real data, we show that PTMM outperforms the other two approaches discussed above. Using real data, we also show that PTMM can recover meaningful TF activity levels and identify post-transcriptionally modified TFs, many of which are supported by other sources.

BACKGROUND:Approximately 70% of all patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) present with lower-risk disease. Some of these patients will initially respond to treatment with growth factors to improve anemia but will eventually cease to respond, while others will be resistant to growth factor therapy. Eventually, all lower-risk MDS patients require multiple transfusions and long-term therapy. While some patients may respond briefly to hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, the majority will not, and new therapeutic options are needed for these lower-risk patients. Our previous clinical trials with ezatiostat (ezatiostat hydrochloride, Telentra{\textregistered}, TLK199), a glutathione S-transferase P1-1 inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of low- to intermediate-risk MDS, have shown significant clinical activity, including multilineage responses as well as durable red-blood-cell transfusion independence. It would be of significant clinical benefit to be able to identify patients most likely to respond to ezatiostat before therapy is initiated. We have previously shown that by using gene expression profiling and grouping by response, it is possible to construct a predictive score that indicates the likelihood that patients without deletion 5q will respond to lenalidomide. The success of that study was based in part on the fact that the profile for response was linked to the biology of the disease.

METHODS:RNA was available on 30 patients enrolled in the trial and analyzed for gene expression on the Illumina HT12v4 whole genome array according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene marker analysis was performed. The selection of genes associated with the responders (R) vs. non-responders (NR) phenotype was obtained using a normalized and rescaled mutual information score (NMI).

CONCLUSIONS:We have shown that an ezatiostat response profile contains two miRNAs that regulate expression of genes known to be implicated in MDS disease pathology. Remarkably, pathway analysis of the response profile revealed that the genes comprising the jun-N-terminal kinase/c-Jun molecular pathway, which is known to be activated by ezatiostat, are under-expressed in patients who respond and over-expressed in patients who were non-responders to the drug, suggesting that both the biology of the disease and the molecular mechanism of action of the drug are positively correlated.},

A. DKK1 expression in SVZ and SGZ,
B. No DKK1 expression in the control
C. -Wnt signaling --{\&}gt; only red fluor. +Wnt signaling --{\&}gt; red and green fluor. -Dkk1 --{\&}gt; 4x+ increase in eGFP expressing NPCs
D. LoxP flanked Dkk1 allels with Tamoxifen-inducible recombinase under nestin promoter. White arrowhead, Dkk1 WT sequence. Adding tamoxifen cut out exon2 in the Dkk1 (grey arrowhead) and left out the exon1 and exon2 flanked sequence (black arrowhead)
E. Derived neurospheres from these mice, and these neurospheres did not express Dkk1 as expected (but the control neurospheres still expressed it)
F. In situ hybridization of Axin2 (marker of Wnt signaling) and Dkk. See hotspots of Axin2 expression but not in control. I don't really see the hotspots s o Isuppose I have to believe the cartoon in Figure F'
G. NPCs derived from Nestin-Dkk1 mice created more secondary neurospheres
H. Although the Nestin-Dkk1 neurospheres were more numerous, they were of approximately the same size.
I. Higher Dkk1 mRNA levels in older mice
J. DCX (marker of new NPCs??), more of it in the 2-year old nestin-Dkk1 mice than in similar age matched mice

Figure 2.
A, B. Adult iNestin-Dkk1 mice had 2.7x increase in proliferating quiescent neural progenitors as marked by BrdU labeling.
C, D. 1.7x increase in label-retaining QNPs (what is label-retaining???)
E. F. 1.3x inrease in ANPs (amplifying neural progenitors)
G, H. 1.3x more NBs
I, J. Similar amounts of neurons in granule cells
K, L. Not all cells had increase in caspase 3 (apoptosis)
M, N. But the neuroblasts (NBs) had an increaseed number of NBs.
O, P. astrocytes don't increase in caspase-3 (apoptosis)

Figure 3.
A. Left, control, with stunted neuroblasts and right, Nestin-Dkk1 highly branched neuroblasts
B. Quantification of left, showing that there are more branch points when you remove Dkk1
C. Longer dendrites of the neuroblasts
D, E, F. Added tamoxifen which turned on YFP in the cells which Dkk is turned off (lineage tracing). And again see longer dendrites, with more branchpoints.
G. Arc, an neuronal activity marker. SEe more of it when you induce Nestin-Dkk.
H is a quantification of G.
I, J, K. Morphology, dendrite length, and branch length did not change in the adult CA3 neurons 

Figure 4. 
A, B. iNestin-Dkk had no effect on the anxiety of the open field
C, D. iNestin-Dkk affected the tail suspension test, and these had more mobility (less immobility?? stupid) Thus, iNestin-Dkk1 is like an antidepressent
E, F. Nestin-Dkk1 preferered sucrose more than their control counterparts, and this was not because they consumed more water overall.

Figure 5.
A. Inducing Nestin-Dkk1 increased the successrate of mice through the T-maze, similar or more than the difference between young (3month) and old (18 mo) mice. Even some of the old Dkk1 mutant mice are similar to the 3 month old mice
B. Experimental setup of their spatial learning and the avoidance paradigm.
C, D. Spatial learning was similar, but retention of learning was much better.
E, F. The difference between the nestin-dkk inducible and non mouse was about the same as the difference between the 3 month and 18 month olds.},

abstract = {In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such "genetically coupled" link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.},

abstract = {Repetitive DNA, especially that due to transposable elements (TEs), makes up a large fraction of many genomes. Dfam is an open access database of families of repetitive DNA elements, in which each family is represented by a multiple sequence alignment and a profile hidden Markov model (HMM). The initial release of Dfam, featured in the 2013 NAR Database Issue, contained 1143 families of repetitive elements found in humans, and was used to produce more than 100 Mb of additional annotation of TE-derived regions in the human genome, with improved speed. Here, we describe recent advances, most notably expansion to 4150 total families including a comprehensive set of known repeat families from four new organisms (mouse, zebrafish, fly and nematode). We describe improvements to coverage, and to our methods for identifying and reducing false annotation. We also describe updates to the website interface. The Dfam website has moved to http://dfam.org. Seed alignments, profile HMMs, hit lists and other underlying data are available for download.},

abstract = {Oct4 is a mammalian POU transcription factor expressed by early embryo cells and germ cells. We report that the activity of Oct4 is essential for the identity of the pluripotential founder cell population in the mammalian embryo. Oct4-deficient embryos develop to the blastocyst stage, but the inner cell mass cells are not pluripotent. Instead, they are restricted to differentiation along the extraembryonic trophoblast lineage. Furthermore, in the absence of a true inner cell mass, trophoblast proliferation is not maintained in Oct4-/- embryos. Expansion of trophoblast precursors is restored, however, by an Oct4 target gene product, fibroblast growth factor-4. Therefore, Oct4 also determines paracrine growth factor signaling from stem cells to the trophectoderm.},

abstract = {Brain development and function depend on the precise regulation of gene expression. However, our understanding of the complexity and dynamics of the transcriptome of the human brain is incomplete. Here we report the generation and analysis of exon-level transcriptome and associated genotyping data, representing males and females of different ethnicities, from multiple brain regions and neocortical areas of developing and adult post-mortem human brains. We found that 86 per cent of the genes analysed were expressed, and that 90 per cent of these were differentially regulated at the whole-transcript or exon level across brain regions and/or time. The majority of these spatio-temporal differences were detected before birth, with subsequent increases in the similarity among regional transcriptomes. The transcriptome is organized into distinct co-expression networks, and shows sex-biased gene expression and exon usage. We also profiled trajectories of genes associated with neurobiological categories and diseases, and identified associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression. This study provides a comprehensive data set on the human brain transcriptome and insights into the transcriptional foundations of human neurodevelopment.},

Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n {\textminus} 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n {\textminus} 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained. A general flowchart helpful in computer programming and a numerical example are included.},

Under the stated hypothesis, H is distributed approximately as $\chi$2(C {\textendash} 1), unless the samples are too small, in which case special approximations or exact tables are provided. One of the most important applications of the test is in detecting differences among the population means.* * Based in part on research supported by the Office of Naval Research at the Statistical Research Center, University of Chicago.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:There is a very large and growing level of effort toward improving the platforms, experiment designs, and data analysis methods for microarray expression profiling. Along with a growing richness in the approaches there is a growing confusion among most scientists as to how to make objective comparisons and choices between them for different applications. There is a need for a standard framework for the microarray community to compare and improve analytical and statistical methods.

RESULTS:We report on a microarray data set comprising 204 in-situ synthesized oligonucleotide arrays, each hybridized with two-color cDNA samples derived from 20 different human tissues and cell lines. Design of the approximately 24 000 60mer oligonucleotides that report approximately 2500 known genes on the arrays, and design of the hybridization experiments, were carried out in a way that supports the performance assessment of alternative data processing approaches and of alternative experiment and array designs. We also propose standard figures of merit for success in detecting individual differential expression changes or expression levels, and for detecting similarities and differences in expression patterns across genes and experiments. We expect this data set and the proposed figures of merit will provide a standard framework for much of the microarray community to compare and improve many analytical and statistical methods relevant to microarray data analysis, including image processing, normalization, error modeling, combining of multiple reporters per gene, use of replicate experiments, and sample referencing schemes in measurements based on expression change.

abstract = {Most homeodomains are unique within a genome, yet many are highly conserved across vast evolutionary distances, implying strong selection on their precise DNA-binding specificities. We determined the binding preferences of the majority (168) of mouse homeodomains to all possible 8-base sequences, revealing rich and complex patterns of sequence specificity and showing that there are at least 65 distinct homeodomain DNA-binding activities. We developed a computational system that successfully predicts binding sites for homeodomain proteins as distant from mouse as Drosophila and C. elegans, and we infer full 8-mer binding profiles for the majority of known animal homeodomains. Our results provide an unprecedented level of resolution in the analysis of this simple domain structure and suggest that variation in sequence recognition may be a factor in its functional diversity and evolutionary success.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) enables programmed diversity of gene expression across tissues and development. We show here that binding in distal intronic regions (>500 nucleotides (nt) from any exon) by Rbfox splicing factors important in development is extensive and is an active mode of splicing regulation. Similarly to exon-proximal sites, distal sites contain evolutionarily conserved GCATG sequences and are associated with AS activation and repression upon modulation of Rbfox abundance in human and mouse experimental systems. As a proof of principle, we validated the activity of two specific Rbfox enhancers in KIF21A and ENAH distal introns and showed that a conserved long-range RNA-RNA base-pairing interaction (an RNA bridge) is necessary for Rbfox-mediated exon inclusion in the ENAH gene. Thus we demonstrate a previously unknown RNA-mediated mechanism for AS control by distally bound RNA-binding proteins.},

abstract = {A simple classification scheme that uses only the presence or absence of a protein domain architecture has been used to determine the phylogeny of 174 complete genomes. The method correctly divides the 174 taxa into Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya and satisfactorily sorts most of the major groups within these superkingdoms. The most challenging problem involved 119 Bacteria, many of which have reduced genomes. When a weighting factor was used that takes account of difference in genome size (number of considered folds), small-genome taxa were mostly grouped with their full-sized counterparts. Although not every organism appears exactly at its classical phylogenetic position in these trees, the agreement appears comparable with the efforts of others by using sophisticated sequence analysis and/or combinations of gene content and gene order. During the course of the study, it emerged that there is a core set of approximately 50 folds that is found in all 174 genomes and a single fold diagnostic of all Archaea.},

abstract = {Presynaptic active zones contain a cytoskeletal matrix called the CAZ, which is thought to play a critical role in the regulation of active zone formation and neurotransmitter release. Recent studies have identified several CAZ components, but little is known about how they contribute to the molecular organization of active zones. Here, we report a novel PDZ [postsynaptic density-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1] interaction between the CAZ protein ERC2/CAST1 and the tandem PDZ protein syntenin-1, which is known to associate with diverse synaptic proteins, including glutamate receptor subunits, SynCAM, and $\beta$-neurexin. This interaction promotes the localization of syntenin-1 at presynaptic ERC2 clusters. In addition to the PDZ interaction, multimerization of both ERC2 and syntenin-1 mediates syntenin-1 clustering. These results suggest that ERC2 promotes presynaptic syntenin-1 clustering by two distinct mechanisms and that syntenin-1 may contribute to the molecular organization of active zones by linking ERC2 and other CAZ components to diverse syntenin-1-associated synaptic proteins.},

This approach overcomes some problems associated with traditional clustering methods, by allowing automatic discovery of similarity based on a subset of attributes, simultaneous clustering of genes and conditions, and overlapped grouping that provides a better representation for genes with multiple functions or regulated by many factors.},

abstract = {Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) substitutions are the most common type of RNA editing in mammals. A-to-I RNA editing is particularly widespread in the brain and is known to play important roles in neuronal functions. In this study we investigated RNA-editing changes during human brain development and maturation, as well as evolutionary conservation of RNA-editing patterns across primates. We used high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to quantify the RNA-editing levels and assess ontogenetic dynamics of RNA editing at more than 8000 previously annotated exonic A-to-I RNA-editing sites in two brain regions--prefrontal cortex and cerebellum--of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We observed substantial conservation of RNA-editing levels between the brain regions, as well as among the three primate species. Evolutionary changes in RNA editing were nonetheless evident, with 40% of the annotated editing sites studied showing divergent editing levels among the three species and 16.5% of sites displaying statistically significant human-specific editing patterns. Across lifespan, we observed an increase of the RNA-editing level with advanced age in both brain regions of all three primate species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent technological advances have enabled high-throughput measurements of protein-protein interactions in the cell, producing large protein interaction networks for various species at an ever-growing pace. However, common technologies like yeast two-hybrid may experience high rates of false positive detection. To combat false positive discoveries, a number of different methods have been recently developed that associate confidence scores with protein interactions. Here, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis and performance assessment among these different methods.

RESULTS:We measure the extent to which each set of confidence scores correlates with similarity of the interacting proteins in terms of function, expression, pattern of sequence conservation, and homology to interacting proteins in other species. We also employ a new metric, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of protein complexes embedded in each network, to assess the power of the different methods. Seven confidence assignment schemes, including those of Bader et al., Deane et al., Deng et al., Sharan et al., and Qi et al., are compared in this work.

CONCLUSION:Although the performance of each assignment scheme varies depending on the particular metric used for assessment, we observe that Deng et al. yields the best performance overall (in three out of four viable measures). Importantly, we also find that utilizing any of the probability assignment schemes is always more beneficial than assuming all observed interactions to be true or equally likely.},

abstract = {The genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorder involves the interplay of common and rare variants and their impact on hundreds of genes. Using exome sequencing, here we show that analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 autism cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or parental controls implicates 22 autosomal genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, plus a set of 107 autosomal genes strongly enriched for those likely to affect risk (FDR <~0.30). These 107 genes, which show unusual evolutionary constraint against mutations, incur de novo loss-of-function mutations in over 5% of autistic subjects. Many of the genes implicated encode proteins for synaptic formation, transcriptional regulation and chromatin-remodelling pathways. These include voltage-gated ion channels regulating the propagation of action potentials, pacemaking and excitability-transcription coupling, as well as histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodellers-most prominently those that mediate post-translational lysine methylation/demethylation modifications of histones.},

H3K27me3 = transcriptionally inactive
H3k27ac = transcriptionally active
H3k1me4 = transcriptionally active

FIgure 1.
A. Schematic of differentiation protocol for the four different cell types, representing the mesendoderm (mesoderm, mesoderm vs ectoderm decision), trophoblast-like (outside of blastocyst, outisde of embryo vs inside embryo decision), neural progenitor (ectoderm vs neuroectoderm decision), MSCs are fibroblastoid (fibroblast-like) cells that represent the mesoderm (?)
B. LOOK WE HAVE SO MUCH DATA. UCSC genoem browser track of all the things they measured in H1. Unclear whether they also measured all 24 histone marks in the 4 other celltypes. My gut says no.
<b>Conclusion</b>: We created a lot of data, and this is how we did it.

"lineage-specific markers" also includes the "lineage" of H1.

Figure 2. 
<b>Q; What are the celltype specific expression, and methylation levels?</b>
A. 2,408 genes showing cell-type-specific expression. Whoo they found known lineage specific markers. ME cells also expressed high levels of H1 ESC markers, e.g. NANOG and Oct3/4 (Pou5F1). 
Also looked at 2,175 annot + 281 unannot (appeared in at least 1 celltype).
Interesting finding: 37.9% of lncRNAs were lineage specific, in contrast to 16.5% of mRNAs
B. "significant percentage" of lncRNA TSS are in long terminal repeats. Single example of this
C. Quantification of TSSs overlapping with LTRs. Not a lot of coding genes! But they looked for de novo lncRNAs but not new coding genes{\ldots}.
D. Expressed repetitive elements in the five different celltypes. ERV1 most differentially expressed in H1 and ME (what about Alu??)
E. Methylation level around 70 H1-specific HERV-H elements (subset of all elements) was found to be significant. IMR90 = primary human fetal lung fibroblasts (known to be globally unmethylated aka hypomethylated). Recovered this methylation when reprogrammed IMR90 to iPSCs

Figure 3.
<b>Q: do early lineage-restricted promoters look like tissue-specific promoters?</b>
A. CGI = CpG island. somatic Promoters of Tissue-specific genes' had low CG content. Blue line = % of all promoters with CGIs
B. Promoters with high CG were enriched for H3k27me3, and low CG marked by DNA methylation. Mostly Developmental genes have high CG and high H3k27me3. A couple lineage-restricted genes (nanog and pou5f1) have low cg and high methylation.
C. Bar graph quantifying how many lowCG, mediumCG, and highCG regions had methylation, h3k27me3, none, or both marks. LowCG has mostly methylation, and high CG has mostly h3k27me3.
D. Active promoter (RNA detected) but promoter still marked by H3k27me3 (but this is population level and we may not know if this holds for individual cells)
E. medium CG promoter POU5F1 (oct3/4) marked by methylation? Doesn't seem that strong.
F. (black arrow) Some low CG also have low h3k27me3, except in MSC and IMR90 where there are broad peaks. Maybe this is to keep low CG promoters in a repressed state?
G. k27ac, k4me3, were correlated with gene expression, and k27me3, and mCG/GC were anti-correlated.
Methylation strongest anti correlation for low CG genes, even though h3k27me3 was similarly anticorrelated across all gene types.
<b>Conclusion</b>: trying to show that methylation of low-CG promoters is more strongly regulated for development than histone marks.

Figure 4. 
<b>Q: Do enhancers have linage-restricted expression and regulation?
</b>Before this figure, they did all kinds of bioinformatics and experimental verification to pin down these specific enhancers. See Supplementary Figure 4.
PMD = partially methylated domain.
A. Most enhancers (by their metric{\ldots}) are low CG, and don't have much h3k27me3 except for MSC and IMR90 kinda
B. Specific H3k27me3 in MSC, IMR90
C. top panel:  expression of repressed/active enhancers pretty much the same across the cell lines. (-1 RPKM???)
middle panel: Repressed enhancers have more H3k27me3 in MSC and IMR90 (statistical test???). H3k27me3 in differentiated cells supposed to repress enhancers from other lineages. 
bottom panel: Also DNA methylation is more prevalent in repressed enhancers. (bottom panel)
D. H1 specific enhancers become methylateds in MSCs and IMR90, and kinda NPC and TBL. Goes with the trend that inactive DNA elements gain methylation over the course of cell differentiation. Also compared to blood and colon (H1 stuff hypomethylated here too)
<b>H3k27me3</b> <b>enriched at certain enhancers at late differentiation. But methyation is at all enhancers and anticorrelates with activity.</b>
E. Correlation of gene expression vs enhancer marks. Mostly highly correlated with k27ac and k2me1, and anticorrelatesd with methylation

Figure 5.
LMR = low methylation region (vs dna methylation valley?)
UMR = unmethylated region.
A. UMR around GSC, expressed specifically in ME. Lots of CpG islands, and unmethylated around entire gene body and BEYONDDDDD
B. No IMR because of partially methylated domains (PMDs). Defined a DMV as hypomethylated region at least 5kb long
C. Numbers of DMVs in all cells. All share 461
D. CpG islands in DMVs seem slightly longer than CGIs not in DMVs.
E. DMVs highly conserved
F. Many DMVs in humans also present in mice (finally! a p value!) Also double-checked to make sure they were present in tissue so they weren't an artifact of cell culture.
G. Many DMVs have TF activity, and 38.4% of them are DNA-biding proteins. (Do they also have RNA bidning protein activity?)
H. Genes in DMVs have a lot of development signaling pathways, and lncRNAs and microRNAs (ones that are known to be hESC specific) [also cancer pathways]
<b>Conclusion: DMVs are a unique class of genomic region that are highly associated with TFs and development

</b>Figure 6. 
A. Percentage of genes in developmental and transcription factor GO categories (??) DMVs aren't just genes with long CGIs or have high CG promoter density or CGI clusters.
B. Most DMVs stay methylated across these celltypes. Is it possible that you need more differentiated cells? if methylated, in at least one cell type.
C. hESC specific microRNA cluster is expressed in H1 and ME, but methylated in all other cell types. (this cluster is capable of reprogramming to pluripotent stem cells too)
D. Genes that stayed unmethylated can still be lineage-specific. 2 gropus of genes: DMVs expressed in at least 4 lineages, and either 
(1) marked by H3k27me3 in at least one. Weak lineage-resticted expression.
(2) not marked by h3k27me3 in any. Expressed in all lineages. Not enriched for housekeeping genes but still have lots of TFs
E. Chromatin state of DMV genes. mostly marked by h3k4me3 or h3k27me3. Many DMVs are only histone modified in differentiated cells ovr sperm of H1?? I don't think so. SPerm has just as many unmodified as IMR90
F. Sperm genome has more DMVs
G. Browser track of HAND1 where sperm is more methylated. TBL = trophoblast-like cells. Also MYC where sperm is way mroe k27me3'd

Figure 7.
Of course they had to tie it to cancer{\ldots}
A. DMVs promoters become way more methylated in tumor tissue. no p value
B, C. Promoters that have high increase in methylation overlap a lot with DMVs in H1 and H1-derived cells. Holds true for both coding genes and lncRNAs. Promoters with DMVs are unmethylated in blood (whoo negative control)
<b>DNA methylation of DMVs not common in normal cells, but common in cancer</b>
D. summary of findings. Switch between using h3k27 to activate early developmental genes, which are then repressed with mehtylation. And then in differentiation, methylation is used to supress other lineage's genes.},

abstract = {In this paper we argue that the alignment of sets of sequences and the construction of phyletic trees cannot be treated separately. The concept of 'good alignment' is meaningless without reference to a phyletic tree, and the construction of phyletic trees presupposes alignment of the sequences. We propose an integrated method that generates both an alignment of a set of sequences and a phyletic tree. In this method a putative tree is used to align the sequences and the alignment obtained is used to adjust the tree; this process is iterated. As a demonstration we apply the method to the analysis of the evolution of 5S rRNA sequences in prokaryotes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:A large choice of tools exists for many standard tasks in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. However, once a project deviates from standard workflows, custom scripts are needed.

RESULTS:We present HTSeq, a Python library to facilitate the rapid development of such scripts. HTSeq offers parsers for many common data formats in HTS projects, as well as classes to represent data, such as genomic coordinates, sequences, sequencing reads, alignments, gene model information and variant calls, and provides data structures that allow for querying via genomic coordinates. We also present htseq-count, a tool developed with HTSeq that preprocesses RNA-Seq data for differential expression analysis by counting the overlap of reads with genes.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:HTSeq is released as an open-source software under the GNU General Public Licence and available from http://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq or from the Python Package Index at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/HTSeq.},

Written in Python, it is designed to be simple and efficient, accessible to non-experts, and reusable in various contexts. In this paper, we present and discuss our design choices for the application programming interface (API) of the project. In particular, we describe the simple and elegant interface shared by all learning and processing units in the library and then discuss its advantages in terms of composition and reusability. The paper also comments on implementation details specific to the Python ecosystem and analyzes obstacles faced by users and developers of the library.

abstract = {We have developed animal models of breast cancer that allow the direct examination of the behavior of individual green fluorescent protein-expressing carcinoma cells in live nonmetastatic and metastatic primary tumors in situ. We have combined this model with multiphoton microscopy to image differences in cell behavior within the primary tumor. Differences in cell behavior between nonmetastatic and metastatic cells in culture and within live primary tumors were correlated with results from cDNA microarray analyses to identify potentially important genetic determinants for breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Using multiphoton microscopy, we found five major differences in carcinoma cell behavior between the nonmetastatic and metastatic primary breast tumors involving extracellular matrix, cell motility, and chemotaxis. Behavioral differences were correlated with seven categories of molecules that were differentially expressed and related to these behaviors. We have found that extracellular matrix composition, actin nucleation factors, molecules involved in mechanical stability and survival, and cell polarity and chemotaxis showed large and consistent differences in gene expression. We conclude that aligning cell behavior in vivo with patterns of gene expression can lead to new insights into the microenvironment of carcinoma cells in the primary tumor and the molecular mechanisms behind cell behavior.},

abstract = {The development of novel high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods for RNA (RNA-Seq) has provided a very powerful mean to study splicing under multiple conditions at unprecedented depth. However, the complexity of the information to be analyzed has turned this into a challenging task. In the last few years, a plethora of tools have been developed, allowing researchers to process RNA-Seq data to study the expression of isoforms and splicing events, and their relative changes under different conditions. We provide an overview of the methods available to study splicing from short RNA-Seq data, which could serve as an entry point for users who need to decide on a suitable tool for a specific analysis. We also attempt to propose a classification of the tools according to the operations they do, to facilitate the comparison and choice of methods.},

abstract = {For the last twenty years fragment assembly was dominated by the "overlap - layout - consensus" algorithms that are used in all currently available assembly tools. However, the limits of these algorithms are being tested in the era of genomic sequencing and it is not clear whether they are the best choice for large-scale assemblies. Although the "overlap - layout - consensus" approach proved to be useful in assembling clones, it faces difficulties in genomic assemblies: the existing algorithms make assembly errors even in bacterial genomes. We abandoned the "overlap - layout - consensus" approach in favour of a new Eulerian Superpath approach that outperforms the existing algorithms for genomic fragment assembly (Pevzner et al. 2001 InProceedings of the Fifth Annual International Conference on Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB-01), 256-26). In this paper we describe our new EULER-DB algorithm that, similarly to the Celera assembler takes advantage of clone-end sequencing by using the double-barreled data. However, in contrast to the Celera assembler, EULER-DB does not mask repeats but uses them instead as a powerful tool for contig ordering. We also describe a new approach for the Copy Number Problem: "How many times a given repeat is present in the genome?". For long nearly-perfect repeats this question is notoriously difficult and some copies of such repeats may be "lost" in genomic assemblies. We describe our EULER-CN algorithm for the Copy Number Problem that proved to be successful in difficult sequencing projects.},

abstract = {Severe malaria by Plasmodium falciparum is a potentially fatal disease, frequently unresponsive to even the most aggressive treatments. Host organ failure is associated with acquired rigidity of infected red blood cells and capillary blockage. In vitro techniques have played an important role in modeling cell deformability. Although, historically they have either been applied to bulk cell populations or to measure single physical parameters of individual cells. In this article, we demonstrate the unique abilities and benefits of elastomeric microchannels to characterize complex behaviors of single cells, under flow, in multicellular capillary blockages. Channels of 8-, 6-, 4-, and 2-microm widths were readily traversed by the 8 microm-wide, highly elastic, uninfected red blood cells, as well as by infected cells in the early ring stages. Trophozoite stages failed to freely traverse 2- to 4-microm channels; some that passed through the 4-microm channels emerged from constricted space with deformations whose shape-recovery could be observed in real time. In 2-microm channels, trophozoites mimicked "pitting," a normal process in the body where spleen beds remove parasites without destroying the red cell. Schizont forms failed to traverse even 6-microm channels and rapidly formed a capillary blockage. Interestingly, individual uninfected red blood cells readily squeezed through the blockages formed by immobile schizonts in a 6-microm capillary. The last observation can explain the high parasitemia in a growing capillary blockage and the well known benefits of early blood transfusion in severe malaria.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Alternative splicing represents a prime mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation whose misregulation is associated with a broad range of human diseases. Despite the vast availability of transcriptome data from different cell types and diseases, bioinformatics-based surveys of alternative splicing patterns remain a major challenge due to limited availability of analytical tools that combine high accuracy and rapidity.

RESULTS:We describe here a novel junction-centric method, jSplice, that enables de novo extraction of alternative splicing events from RNA-sequencing data with high accuracy, reliability and speed. Application to clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines and 65 ccRCC patients revealed experimentally validatable alternative splicing changes and signatures able to prognosticate ccRCC outcome. In the aggregate, our results propose jSplice as a key analytic tool for the derivation of cell context-dependent alternative splicing patterns from large-scale RNA-sequencing datasets.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:jSplice is a standalone Python application freely available at http://www.mhs.biol.ethz.ch/research/krek/jsplice

A. Schematic of their experiment. Used human glial progenitor cells (GPCs), sorted on A2B5+ and PSA-NCAM-. Then infected with CMV-EGFP to stain in the brain, and then xenografted onto neonatal immune-deficient mice. They knew that this vector continued to express GFP for at least 1 year in vivo
B. Representative scatterplot of where the human nuclear antigen (hNuclei)+ cells appeared in three coronal sections of the brain.
C. Human astrocytes, denoted by arrows, express both EGFP and hNuclei. Also, they are star-shaped as they shoudl be.
D. Showing corpos callosum and cortical layers V and VI invated by human astrocytes.
E. At 11 months, see EGFP throughout the cortex
F. At 14 months, see EGFP+/hNuclei+ very dense in hippocampus (highest density in "dentate") ??
G. Comparison of human astrocytes to murine astrocytes (human: much larger)
H. Uhh not a histogram. Just a bar plot. Bar plot comparing the maximum diameter of mouse vs chimeric human vs human astrocytes. Chimeric human and  human are comparable.

Figure 2.
A. Chimeric human astrocyte reaches out to vasculature of 1 month old mouse
B. More specifically showing that human astrocytes are touching vasculature, with the laminin stain of the blood vessels
C. Left, chimera (???) right, human brain??? Left is definitely chimera and they're trying to show that the strucures are mophologically similar.
D. Representative example of a 600um+ process of human chimeric cells in the mouse brain, touching at last 14 mouse astrocytes
E. The very long EGFP+/GFAP+ processes had many mitochondria
F. Human astrocytes with Cx43 hemichannels, presumably connected to mouse astroglia
Added Alexa 594, a gap junction finder, which diffused from EGFP+ cells to neighboring EGFP- cells
G. While not all hNuclei+ cells expressed GFAP, other expressed the human-specific isoform of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 (a prototypic marker of parenchymal glial progenitor cells). So here we see both.

Figure 3.
A. Rhod2 (Ca2+ indicator). EGFP staining of cell (inset, zoom out of the same region), and GFAP (marker of human astrocytes)
B. Mouse, chimeric glial progentior cells probably, and probably chimeric astrocytes. Don't know how to read thos graphs. The slopes look similar but I don't know what the frequency plot is supposed to be. 
Previous stuff is supposed to support the idea that most of the human cells differentiated into protoplasmic astrocytes.
C. Higher input resistance of the EGFP cells that are morphologically smaller, and coupled to fewer things. Larger ones were coupledto more things, and had lower inmput resistance.
D. Left, Bar plot summarizing the left scatterplot, showing hte average input resistance.
Right, membrane potential is no different (could be affecting input resistance)
E. Tracking of Ca2+ through EGFP+ astrocyte. (numbers = ?? distance or time??)
F. Line scan image?? of mouse astrocyte. Didn't go as far (green line) as human astrocyte in G?
G. Human astrocyte line scan image
H. Velocity of intracellular Ca2+ waves in host murine, chimeric human, and regular human astrocytes

Figure 4. 
A. excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)showing steeper slopes in human chimeric mice. Thus, the parts of brain with human glia had better excitatory synaptic transmission
B. Long term potentiation (LTP). Used two trains of high frequency stimulation (HFS). We see that the slope of the chimeric mouse is significantly higher after stimulation.
C. APV = NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist. Amount of decreased fEPSP after addition of APV. The difference for chimeras is small compared to the allografted and the unengrafted, so NMDA was probably not THAT important
D. Checking if ATP played a role in changing the stimulus response. Added DPCPX, a adenosine A1 recetptor, and this didn't increase the slope of the unengrafted contorls (But what about the chimeri ones??)
E. DPCPX also did not decrease the threshold of induction for LTP in unengrafted. (Also, can we see what happens when you add it to chimeras???)

Figure 5.
A. Addition of TNF-alpha increased both the AMPA receptor current and the AMPA GluR1 labeling
B. Exposing the hippocampus to TNF-alpha, and we see more GluR1 in the chimeric mice. But NR1 expression was unaffected.
C. No additional TNFa, but looking just at the expression of TNFa, GluR1, and NR1 in unengrafted vs chimeric cells. TNFa and GluR1 are higher, but NR1 is not.
D. Added Thalidomide, a blood-brain-barrier permeable inhibitor of TNFa. Less staining of TNFa and GluR1 in hippocampus, but not NR1.
E. Adding thalidomide decreased the LTP of chimeric mice.
F. Adding thalidomide didn't change the contribution of the NMDA receptro to the fEPSP. So TNFa production is decreased, but not its receptors
G. Ser845 (PKA site) and Ser831 (PKC/CaMKII site). See more phosphorylation of the Ser831, which was inhibited by addition of Thalidomide. But Ser845 was unaffected.

Figure 6.
A. (hippocampal learning) Mice with human GPC grafts learned Freezing behavior faster with foot shock treatment. Showed there was no change in hippocampal-independent learning later.
B. (hippocampal learning again) This time, shock after a visual stimulus. Again, mice with chimeric brains exhibited improved response. Also tested in another room to make sure they didn't just learning freezing well.
C. Learning in the Barnes maze, human chimeric mice made fewere errors and figured it out faster.
D. Object-location memory task. Human chimeric brain mice seemed to notice more greatly when the object locations changed. Regular mice were unaffected by thalidomide, but human GPC xeongrafted mice were affected.

abstract = {How to selecting a small subset out of the thousands of genes in microarray data is important for accurate classification of phenotypes. Widely used methods typically rank genes according to their differential expressions among phenotypes and pick the top-ranked genes. We observe that feature sets so obtained have certain redundancy and study methods to minimize it. We propose a minimum redundancy - maximum relevance (MRMR) feature selection framework. Genes selected via MRMR provide a more balanced coverage of the space and capture broader characteristics of phenotypes. They lead to significantly improved class predictions in extensive experiments on 6 gene expression data sets: NCI, Lymphoma, Lung, Child Leukemia, Leukemia, and Colon. Improvements are observed consistently among 4 classification methods: Naive Bayes, Linear discriminant analysis, Logistic regression, and Support vector machines. SUPPLIMENTARY: The top 60 MRMR genes for each of the datasets are listed in http://crd.lbl.gov/{\textasciitilde}cding/MRMR/. More information related to MRMR methods can be found at http://www.hpeng.net/.},

abstract = {We all know that gene expression occurs within cells, yet we do not think of expression in terms of its fundamental unit -- a single cell. Instead, we understand the expression of genes in terms of a cell population as all of our information comes from samples containing millions of cells. From a complex mixture of cells, we attempt to infer the probable state of an average cell in the population. In truth, what we obtain is an averaged cell, a contrivance for representing biological knowledge beyond the limits of detection. We never know the variation among the members of the population that our methods average into a mean. Recent technological advances allow the precise measurement of single-cell transcriptional states to study this variability more rigorously. How genes are expressed in the population is strikingly different to what we have assumed from extrapolating to an average cell. Does the average cell actually exist? As we discuss, it is becoming increasingly clear that it doesn't.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) offers high resolution, genome-wide analysis of DNA-protein interactions. However, current standard methods require abundant starting material in the range of 1-20 million cells per immunoprecipitation, and remain a bottleneck to the acquisition of biologically relevant epigenetic data. Using a ChIP-seq protocol optimised for low cell numbers (down to 100,000 cells/IP), we examined the performance of the ChIP-seq technique on a series of decreasing cell numbers.

RESULTS:We present an enhanced native ChIP-seq method tailored to low cell numbers that represents a 200-fold reduction in input requirements over existing protocols. The protocol was tested over a range of starting cell numbers covering three orders of magnitude, enabling determination of the lower limit of the technique. At low input cell numbers, increased levels of unmapped and duplicate reads reduce the number of unique reads generated, and can drive up sequencing costs and affect sensitivity if ChIP is attempted from too few cells.

CONCLUSIONS:The optimised method presented here considerably reduces the input requirements for performing native ChIP-seq. It extends the applicability of the technique to isolated primary cells and rare cell populations (e.g. biobank samples, stem cells), and in many cases will alleviate the need for cell culture and any associated alteration of epigenetic marks. However, this study highlights a challenge inherent to ChIP-seq from low cell numbers: as cell input numbers fall, levels of unmapped sequence reads and PCR-generated duplicate reads rise. We discuss a number of solutions to overcome the effects of reducing cell number that may aid further improvements to ChIP performance.},

abstract = {Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can occur when two drugs interact with the same gene product. Most available information about gene-drug relationships is contained within the scientific literature, but is dispersed over a large number of publications, with thousands of new publications added each month. In this setting, automated text mining is an attractive solution for identifying gene-drug relationships and aggregating them to predict novel DDIs. In previous work, we have shown that gene-drug interactions can be extracted from Medline abstracts with high fidelity - we extract not only the genes and drugs, but also the type of relationship expressed in individual sentences (e.g. metabolize, inhibit, activate and many others). We normalize these relationships and map them to a standardized ontology. In this work, we hypothesize that we can combine these normalized gene-drug relationships, drawn from a very broad and diverse literature, to infer DDIs. Using a training set of established DDIs, we have trained a random forest classifier to score potential DDIs based on the features of the normalized assertions extracted from the literature that relate two drugs to a gene product. The classifier recognizes the combinations of relationships, drugs and genes that are most associated with the gold standard DDIs, correctly identifying 79.8% of assertions relating interacting drug pairs and 78.9% of assertions relating noninteracting drug pairs. Most significantly, because our text processing method captures the semantics of individual gene-drug relationships, we can construct mechanistic pharmacological explanations for the newly-proposed DDIs. We show how our classifier can be used to explain known DDIs and to uncover new DDIs that have not yet been reported.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.

RESULTS:To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 {\texttimes} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.},

abstract = {Pervasive transcription of the human genome generates RNAs whose mode of formation and functions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we combine RNA-seq with detailed mechanistic studies to describe a transcript type derived from protein-coding genes. The resulting RNAs, which we call DoGs for downstream of gene containing transcripts, possess long~non-coding regions (often >45 kb) and remain chromatin bound. DoGs are inducible by osmotic stress~through an IP3 receptor signaling-dependent pathway, indicating active regulation. DoG levels are increased by decreased termination of the upstream transcript, a previously undescribed mechanism for rapid transcript induction. Relative depletion of polyA signals in DoG regions correlates with increased levels of DoGs after osmotic stress. We detect DoG transcription in several human cell lines and provide evidence for thousands of DoGs genome wide.},

abstract = {A-to-I RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA is a post-transcriptional modification that is crucial for normal life and development in vertebrates. RNA editing has been shown to be very abundant in the human transcriptome, specifically at the primate-specific Alu elements. The functional role of this wide-spread effect is still not clear; it is believed that editing of transcripts is a mechanism for their down-regulation via processes such as nuclear retention or RNA degradation. Here we combine 2 neural gene expression datasets with genome-level editing information to examine the relation between the expression of ADAR genes with the expression of their target genes. Specifically, we computed the spatial correlation across structures of post-mortem human brains between ADAR and a large set of targets that were found to be edited in their Alu repeats. Surprisingly, we found that a large fraction of the edited genes are positively correlated with ADAR, opposing the assumption that editing would reduce expression. When considering the correlations between ADAR and its targets over development, 2 gene subsets emerge, positively correlated and negatively correlated with ADAR expression. Specifically, in embryonic time points, ADAR is positively correlated with many genes related to RNA processing and regulation of gene expression. These findings imply that the suggested mechanism of regulation of expression by editing is probably not a global one; ADAR expression does not have a genome wide effect reducing the expression of editing targets. It is possible, however, that RNA editing by ADAR in non-coding regions of the gene might be a part of a more complex expression regulation mechanism.},

abstract = {Understanding how RNA binding proteins control the splicing code is fundamental to human biology and disease. Here, we present a comprehensive study to elucidate how heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) proteins, among the most abundant RNA binding proteins, coordinate to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in human cells. Using splicing-sensitive microarrays, crosslinking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), and cDNA sequencing, we find that more than half of all AS events are regulated by multiple hnRNP proteins and that some combinations of hnRNP proteins exhibit significant synergy, whereas others act antagonistically. Our analyses reveal position-dependent RNA splicing maps, in vivo consensus binding sites, a surprising level of cross- and autoregulation among hnRNP proteins, and the coordinated regulation by hnRNP proteins of dozens of other RNA binding proteins and genes associated with cancer. Our findings define an unprecedented degree of complexity and compensatory relationships among hnRNP proteins and their splicing targets that likely confer robustness to cells.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a key cellular mechanism for generating distinct isoforms, whose relative abundances regulate critical cellular processes. It is therefore essential that inclusion levels of alternative exons be tightly regulated. However, how the precision of inclusion levels among individual cells is governed is poorly understood. Using single-cell gene expression, we show that the precision of inclusion levels of alternative exons is determined by the degree of evolutionary conservation at their flanking intronic regions. Moreover, the inclusion levels of alternative exons, as well as the expression levels of the transcripts harboring them, also contribute to this precision. We further show that alternative exons whose inclusion levels are considerably changed during stem cell differentiation are also subject to this regulation. Our results imply that alternative splicing is coordinately regulated to achieve accuracy in relative isoform abundances and that such accuracy may be important in determining cell fate.},

abstract = {A minor class of introns with noncanonical splice (AT-AC) and branch site sequences exists in metazoan protein coding genes. We have established a HeLa cell in vitro system that accurately splices a pre-mRNA substrate containing such an intron from the human P120 gene. Splicing occurs via a lariat intermediate whose branch site A residue is predicted to bulge from a duplex formed with the low abundance U12 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which we confirm by psoralen cross-linking. Native gel electrophoresis reveals that U11, U12, and U5 snRNPs assemble onto the P120 pre-mRNA to form splicing complexes. Inhibition of P120 splicing by 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides complementary to U12 or U5 demonstrates that U12 and U5 snRNPs perform essential roles in the AT-AC spliceosome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:It is a commonly accepted belief that cancer cells modify their transcriptional state during the progression of the disease. We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-throughput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes. The deep mathematical basis of the approach allows us to suggest that this principle is, hopefully, of general applicability for other diseases.},

abstract = {Much of the knowledge about cell differentiation and function in the immune system has come from studies in mice, but the relevance to human immunology, diseases, and therapy has been challenged, perhaps more from anecdotal than comprehensive evidence. To this end, we compare two large compendia of transcriptional profiles of human and mouse immune cell types. Global transcription profiles are conserved between corresponding cell lineages. The expression patterns of most orthologous genes are conserved, particularly for lineage-specific genes. However, several hundred genes show clearly divergent expression across the examined cell lineages, and among them, 169 genes did so even with highly stringent criteria. Finally, regulatory mechanisms--reflected by regulators' differential expression or enriched cis-elements--are conserved between the species but to a lower degree, suggesting that distinct regulation may underlie some of the conserved transcriptional responses.},

abstract = {One hallmark of tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is the presence of highly epileptogenic dysplastic cerebral cortex (tubers) composed of abnormally shaped neurons and giant cells. Mutation of the TSC gene (TSC2) may disrupt differentiation and maturation of neuronal precursors, since the TSC2 gene product tuberin is believed to regulate cellular proliferation. To test the hypothesis that cells in tubers may retain the molecular phenotype of embryonic or immature neurons, tubers from five TSC patients were probed with antibodies to proteins expressed in neuronal precursors (nestin, Ki-67, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen). Many dysmorphic neurons and giant cells in tubers were stained by these antibodies, while neurons in adjacent normal and control cortex were not labeled. To further characterize the molecular phenotype of cells in tubers, we developed a methodology in which poly(A)+ mRNA was amplified from immunohistochemically labeled single cells in paraffin-embedded brain specimens. This approach enabled us to detect mRNAs encoding nestin, and other cytoskeletal elements, cell cycle markers, and synthetic enzymes present in individual nestin-stained cells by means of reverse Northern blotting. We conclude that the presence of immature phenotypic markers (mRNAs and proteins) within tubers suggests disruption of cell cycle regulation and neuronal maturation in TSC during cortical development. Characterization of multiple mRNAs within fixed, immunohistochemically labeled cells provides a powerful tool for studying gene expression and the molecular pathophysiology of many neurologic diseases.},

MMP3 has two main domains: proteolytic and hemopexin (HPX) domain which binds substrates and directs MMP3 specificity.
A. Comparison of a catalytically inactive mutant of MMP3 versus the regular MMP3 showed similar crazy branching.
B. Then they made a construct that had only the HPX domain, and this created the same branching as the whole MMP3. Thus the action of MMP3 is independent of proteolytic activity.
C {\&}amp; D. Fluorescence microscopy and H{\&}amp;E staining of just the MMP3-HPX domain versus control, which showed abnormal outgrowth. Shows taht just the HPX domain is necessary for the abnormality.
E-H. Compared MMP10, a relative of MMP3, and whether the MMP10-HPX domain which is 67% similar to the MMP3 domain, is sufficient to create abnormal outgrowth. It was not.

Figure 3.
A. Showing that their bait for the Yeast 2 hybrid was MMP3-HPX.
B. After the screen, they found 58 genes, and because they're trying to show that the effect is driven by extracellular stuff, they focused on the genes which have extracellular products.
C. They asked whether MMP3 interacted with other C-termini, since the Wnt5b was a c-terminus, and they wanted to know whether MMP3 interacted with other Wnt C-termini expressed in the mammary gland. ONly with Wnt5a and Wnt5b.
D. Performed MORE Y2H screens, this time deleting ends off of the HPX domain and found that the important part was between aa 232-287. Side Q: Is 20 amino acids per cut common? How was that decided as the correct way to pinpoint the important domain of a protein??
E. Replaced hinge or blades in the MMP10 protein with MMP3 to see which part of MMP3 conferred Y2H activity. Turns out it's Blade III.
F. What is "no" and how is it different from "mock"? What does PNGase-F do? Looking it up, it's a glycoprotein cleaver but this is not a glycoprotein just regular proteins...
G {\&}amp; H. Left, minimal MMP3 binding domain and right, Wnt5b structure. They argue that the binding domain of MMP3 "looks like" the Wnt5b one, suggesting there is some competition. But they don't use structural homology software which would have been an easy way to get a quantitative value.

Figure 4.
A. Mouse MEC line Eph4 incubated with recombinant mouse Wnt5b had more NFAT protein, which is a marker of noncanonical Wnt activity from a Ca2+ response.
B. In the presence of Wnt5b, the NFAT reporter signal increases. With Wnt5b and MMP3, we see less NFAT in comparison to just Wnt5b. They're arguing that Wnt5b and MMP3 are competing.
C. Wnt5b competes with Wnt3a for the TOP, a Frizzled co-receptor. It wasn't as much as the known Wnt agonist Dickkopf-related protein (DKK-1).
D. WHy are thye using a different cell line now? (NMuMG) Eph4 was a mammary gland tissue, but derived from a metastatic site, the kidney. But NMuMG is actually mammary gland. Seems weird... Anyways, they show that With Wnt3, LRP6 gets phosphorylated as usual, but when you add Wnt5 or DKK1, there is less phosphorylation. And When you add MMP3, this recorvers some of the lost phosphorylation by Wnt5b but not by DKK1.
E. With Wnt5b, less clones produced by MEC cells, but addition of MMP3 reversed.
F, G, H: Addition of either Wnt5b or DKK1 strongly decreased branching and impaired epithelial outgrowth.
I. Cartoon summary of what they've found, that Wnt5b activates teh noncanonical Wnt pathway.

Figure 5.
A-D. Overexpression of Wnt1 and Wnt2 created branching and hypermorphic epithelial outgrowth similar to MMP3. Wnt4 overexpresion led to dysplasia of terminal end buds.
E, F, G. The authors propose that inhibition of Wnt5b by MMP3 may cause overactivation of the canonical Wnt pathway, leading to extra stabilization and translocation of beta-catenin into the nucleus. Indeed, both with MMP3 and Wnt1 we see an increase in nuclear beta-catenin. This was also observed with MMP3-HPX.
H,I. Using Axin2-LacZ as a reporter for canoncial Wnt signaling activity, we see there is more LacZ (under control of Axin2 promoter, a target of beta-catenin)  in the samples with overexpressed MMP3-FL.

Figure 6. 
A. +MMP3 --{\&}gt; increase in basal/MaSC cell population in mammary glands. Left, Facs sorting view, right, quantified view.
B. With the addition of MMP3, saw an increase in clonality of the cells.
C. Increase in sphere formation was countered by addition of tankyrase inhibitor JW-55 (inhibitor of canonical wnt signaling)
D. Overexpression of MMP3 leads to increased "reconstitution" (??) of MECs, indicating that MMP3 could promote MaSC function.

Figure 7.
A. Mice with MMP3 knockdown had less cells expressing basal surface markers.
B. MMP3 null mice also produced fewer spheres (less clonality)
C-D. If added Wnt3a (canonical ligand) or by knocking down Wnt5b (inhibitor of canonical), then increased in number of spheres generated.
E. In MMP3 null MECs, they were not as able to reconstitute the mammary gland as the control ones, indicating that there were fewere stem cells in the MMP3 null ones. They did some linear regression analysis (33 points? seems okay) to estimate the number of stem cells per cells transplanted, andthere's mroe per the control group than the MMP3 null ones, suggesting that MMP3 are regulators of mammary stem cells (MaSCs)
F. Model of MMP3 and MaSC interaction.},

abstract = {High-throughput single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an established and powerful method to investigate transcriptomic cell-to-cell variation, and has revealed new cell types, and new insights into developmental process and stochasticity in gene expression. There are now several published scRNA-seq protocols, which all sequence transcriptomes from a minute amount of starting material. Therefore, a key question is how these methods compare in terms of sensitivity of detection of mRNA molecules, and accuracy of quantification of gene expression. Here, we assessed the sensitivity and accuracy of many published data sets based on standardized spike-ins with a uniform raw data processing pipeline. We developed a flexible and fast UMI counting tool (https://github.com/vals/umis) which is compatible with all UMI based protocols. This allowed us to relate these parameters to sequencing depth, and discuss the trade offs between the different methods. To confirm our results, we performed experiments on cells from the same population using three different protocols. We also investigated the effect of RNA degradation on spike-in molecules, and the average efficiency of scRNA-seq on spike-in molecules versus endogenous RNAs.},

abstract = {Post-transcriptional mechanisms play critical roles in the control of gene expression during neuronal development and maturation as they allow for faster responses to environmental cues and provide spatially-restricted compartments for local control of protein expression. These mechanisms depend on the interaction of cis-acting elements present in the mRNA sequence and trans-acting factors, such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that bind to those cis-elements and regulate mRNA stability, subcellular localization, and translation. Recent studies have uncovered an unexpected complexity in these interactions, where coding and non-coding RNAs, termed competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), compete for binding to miRNAs. This competition can, thereby, control a larger number of miRNA target transcripts. However, competing RNA networks also extend to competition between target mRNAs for binding to limited amounts of RBPs. In this review, we present evidence that competitions between target mRNAs for binding to RBPs also occur in neurons, where they affect transcript stability and transport into axons and dendrites as well as translation. In addition, we illustrate the complexity of these mechanisms by demonstrating that RBPs and miRNAs also compete for target binding and regulation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in post-transcriptional control of gene expression, including splicing, transport, polyadenylation and RNA stability. To model protein-RNA interactions by considering all available sources of information, it is necessary to integrate the rapidly growing RBP experimental data with the latest genome annotation, gene function, RNA sequence and structure. Such integration is possible by matrix factorization, where current approaches have an undesired tendency to identify only a small number of the strongest patterns with overlapping features. Because protein-RNA interactions are orchestrated by multiple factors, methods that identify discriminative patterns of varying strengths are needed.

RESULTS:We have developed an integrative orthogonality-regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (iONMF) to integrate multiple data sources and discover non-overlapping, class-specific RNA binding patterns of varying strengths. The orthogonality constraint halves the effective size of the factor model and outperforms other NMF models in predicting RBP interaction sites on RNA. We have integrated the largest data compendium to date, which includes 31 CLIP experiments on 19 RBPs involved in splicing (such as hnRNPs, U2AF2, ELAVL1, TDP-43, and FUS) and processing of 3'UTR (Ago, IGF2BP). We show that the integration of multiple data sources improves the predictive accuracy of retrieval of RNA binding sites. In our study the key predictive factors of protein-RNA interactions were the position of RNA structure and sequence motifs, RBP co-binding and gene region type. We report on a number of protein-specific patterns, many of which are consistent with experimentally determined properties of RBPs.

abstract = {The anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ) frequently causes cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs), including maculopapular eruption (MPE), hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). We reported that SJS/TEN caused by CBZ is strongly associated with the HLA-B*1502 gene in Han Chinese. Here, we extended our genetic study to different types of CBZ-cADRs (91 patients, including 60 patients with SJS/TEN, 13 patients with hypersensitivity syndrome and 18 with maculopapular exanthema versus 144 tolerant controls). We used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to screen the genetic association of 278 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which cover the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, heat shock protein and CBZ-metabolic enzymes, including CYP3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 1A2 and epoxide hydrolase 1. In addition, we genotyped 20 microsatellites in the MHC region and performed HLA-typing to construct the recombinant map. We narrowed the susceptibility locus for CBZ-SJS/TEN to within 86 kb flanking the HLA-B gene on the extended B*1502 haplotype, and confirmed the association of B*1502 with SJS/TEN [Pc=1.6x10, odds ratio (OR)=1357; 95% confidence interval (CI)=193.4-8838.3]. By contrast to CBZ-SJS/TEN, HLA-B*1502 association was not observed in the MPE or HSS groups: MPE was associated with SNPs in the HLA-E region and a nearby allele, HLA-A*3101 (Pc=2.2x10, OR=17.5; 95% CI=4.6-66.5), and HSS with SNPs in the motilin gene (Pc=0.0064, OR=7.11; 95% CI=3.1-16.5) located terminal to the MHC class II genes. No SNPs in genes involved in CBZ metabolism were associated with CBZ-induced cADRs. Our data suggest that HLA-B*1502 could contribute to the pathogenesis of CBZ-SJS/TEN, and that genetic susceptibility to CBZ-induced cADRs is phenotype-specific.},

abstract = {Understanding how RNA binding proteins control the splicing code is fundamental to human biology and disease. Here, we present a comprehensive study to elucidate how heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) proteins, among the most abundant RNA binding proteins, coordinate to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in human cells. Using splicing-sensitive microarrays, crosslinking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), and cDNA sequencing, we find that more than half of all AS events are regulated by multiple hnRNP proteins and that some combinations of hnRNP proteins exhibit significant synergy, whereas others act antagonistically. Our analyses reveal position-dependent RNA splicing maps, in vivo consensus binding sites, a surprising level of cross- and autoregulation among hnRNP proteins, and the coordinated regulation by hnRNP proteins of dozens of other RNA binding proteins and genes associated with cancer. Our findings define an unprecedented degree of complexity and compensatory relationships among hnRNP proteins and their splicing targets that likely confer robustness to cells.},

abstract = {It has been previously observed that the intrinsically weak variant GC donor sites, in order to be recognized by the U2-type spliceosome, possess strong consensus sequences maximized for base pair formation with U1 and U5/U6 snRNAs. However, variability in signal strength is a fundamental mechanism for splice site selection in alternative splicing. Here we report human alternative GC-AG introns (for the first time from any species), and show that while constitutive GC-AG introns do possess strong signals at their donor sites, a large subset of alternative GC-AG introns possess weak consensus sequences at their donor sites. Surprisingly, this subset of alternative isoforms shows strong consensus at acceptor exon positions 1 and 2. The improved consensus at the acceptor exon can facilitate a strong interaction with U5 snRNA, which tethers the two exons for ligation during the second step of splicing. Further, these isoforms nearly always possess alternative acceptor sites and exhibit particularly weak polypyrimidine tracts characteristic of AG-dependent introns. The acceptor exon nucleotides are part of the consensus required for the U2AF(35)-mediated recognition of AG in such introns. Such improved consensus at acceptor exons is not found in either normal or alternative GT-AG introns having weak donor sites or weak polypyrimidine tracts. The changes probably reflect mechanisms that allow GC-AG alternative intron isoforms to cope with two conflicting requirements, namely an apparent need for differential splice strength to direct the choice of alternative sites and a need for improved donor signals to compensate for the central mismatch base pair (C-A) in the RNA duplex of U1 snRNA and the pre-mRNA. The other important findings include (i) one in every twenty alternative introns is a GC-AG intron, and (ii) three of every five observed GC-AG introns are alternative isoforms.},

For a small number of data points, real-time interaction is possible and overplotting is usually not a major problem. When the number of plotted points is large, however, display techniques that deal with overplotting and slow production are important. This article addresses these two problems. Topics include density representation by gray scale or by symbol area, alternatives to brushing, and animation sequences. We also discuss techniques that are generally applicable, including interactive graphical subset selection from any plot in a collection of scatterplots and comparison of scatterplot matrices.},

abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

Such "exemplars" can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called "affinity propagation," which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

abstract = {Little is known about the expression levels or function of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in normal and neoplastic cells, although it is becoming clear that miRNAs play important roles in the regulation of gene expression during development [Ambros, V. (2003) Cell 113, 673-676; McManus, M. T. (2003) Semin. Cancer Biol. 13, 253-258]. We now report the genomewide expression profiling of miRNAs in human B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by using a microarray containing hundreds of human precursor and mature miRNA oligonucleotide probes. This approach allowed us to identify significant differences in miRNome expression between CLL samples and normal CD5+ B cells; data were confirmed by Northern blot analyses and real-time RT-PCR. At least two distinct clusters of CLL samples can be identified that were associated with the presence or absence of Zap-70 expression, a predictor of early disease progression. Two miRNA signatures were associated with the presence or absence of mutations in the expressed Ig variableregion genes or with deletions at 13q14, respectively. These data suggest that miRNA expression patterns have relevance to the biological and clinical behavior of this leukemia.},

abstract = {Cellular immunophenotypic studies were performed on a cohort of randomly selected IgM(+) B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cases for which Ig V(H) and V(L) gene sequences were available. The cases were categorized based on V gene mutation status and CD38 expression and analyzed for treatment history and survival. The B-CLL cases could be divided into 2 groups. Those patients with unmutated V genes displayed higher percentages of CD38(+) B-CLL cells (>/=30%) than those with mutated V genes that had lower percentages of CD38(+) cells (<30%). Patients in both the unmutated and the >/=30% CD38(+) groups responded poorly to continuous multiregimen chemotherapy (including fludarabine) and had shorter survival. In contrast, the mutated and the <30% CD38(+) groups required minimal or no chemotherapy and had prolonged survival. These observations were true also for those patients who stratified to the Rai intermediate risk category. In the mutated and the <30% CD38(+) groups, males and females were virtually equally distributed, whereas in the unmutated and the >/=30% CD38(+) groups, a marked male predominance was found. Thus, Ig V gene mutation status and the percentages of CD38(+) B-CLL cells appear to be accurate predictors of clinical outcome in B-CLL patients. These parameters, especially CD38 expression that can be analyzed conveniently in most clinical laboratories, should be valuable adjuncts to the present staging systems for predicting the clinical course in individual B-CLL cases. Future evaluations of new therapeutic strategies and drugs should take into account the different natural histories of patients categorized in these manners.},

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Novel technologies brought in unprecedented amounts of high-throughput sequencing data along with great challenges in their analysis and interpretation. The percent-spliced-in (PSI, ) metric estimates the incidence of single-exon-skipping events and can be computed directly by counting reads that align to known or predicted splice junctions. However, the majority of human splicing events are more complex than single-exon skipping.

RESULTS:In this short report, we present a framework that generalizes the metric to arbitrary classes of splicing events. We change the view from exon centric to intron centric and split the value of into two indices, and , measuring the rate of splicing at the 5' and 3' end of the intron, respectively. The advantage of having two separate indices is that they deconvolute two distinct elementary acts of the splicing reaction. The completeness of splicing index is decomposed in a similar way. This framework is implemented as bam2ssj, a BAM-file-processing pipeline for strand-specific counting of reads that align to splice junctions or overlap with splice sites. It can be used as a consistent protocol for quantifying splice junctions from RNA-seq data because no such standard procedure currently exists.

AVAILABILITY:The C code of bam2ssj is open source and is available at https://github.com/pervouchine/bam2ssj

abstract = {The neuronal function of Cys-loop neurotransmitter receptors is established; however, their role in non-neuronal cells is poorly defined. As brain tumors are enriched in the neurotransmitter glycine, we studied the expression and function of glycine receptors (GlyRs) in glioma cells. Human brain tumor biopsies selectively expressed the GlyR $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$3 subunits, which have nuclear localization signals (NLSs). The mouse glioma cell line GL261 expressed GlyR $\alpha$1, and knockdown of GlyR $\alpha$1 protein expression impaired the self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity of GL261 glioma cells, as shown by a neurosphere assay and GL261 cell inoculation in vivo, respectively. We furthermore showed that the pronounced tumorigenic effect of GlyR $\alpha$1 relies on a new intracellular signaling function that depends on the NLS region in the large cytosolic loop and impacts on GL261 glioma cell gene regulation. Stable expression of GlyR $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$3 loops rescued the self-renewal capacity of GlyR $\alpha$1 knockdown cells, which demonstrates their functional equivalence. The new intracellular signaling function identified here goes beyond the well-established role of GlyRs as neuronal ligand-gated ion channels and defines NLS-containing GlyRs as new potential targets for brain tumor therapies.},

abstract = {Many tumour cells have elevated rates of glucose uptake but reduced rates of oxidative phosphorylation. This persistence of high lactate production by tumours in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis, was first noted by Otto Warburg more than 75 yr ago. How tumour cells establish this altered metabolic phenotype and whether it is essential for tumorigenesis is as yet unknown. Here we show that a single switch in a splice isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase is necessary for the shift in cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis and that this promotes tumorigenesis. Tumour cells have been shown to express exclusively the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase. Here we use short hairpin RNA to knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 expression in human cancer cell lines and replace it with pyruvate kinase M1. Switching pyruvate kinase expression to the M1 (adult) isoform leads to reversal of the Warburg effect, as judged by reduced lactate production and increased oxygen consumption, and this correlates with a reduced ability to form tumours in nude mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that M2 expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and that this metabolic phenotype provides a selective growth advantage for tumour cells in vivo.},

abstract = {During postnatal development the heart undergoes a rapid and dramatic transition to adult function through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, including alternative splicing (AS). Here we perform deep RNA-sequencing on RNA from cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts to conduct a high-resolution analysis of transcriptome changes during postnatal mouse heart development. We reveal extensive changes in gene expression and AS that occur primarily between postnatal days 1 and 28. Cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts show reciprocal regulation of gene expression reflecting differences in proliferative capacity, cell adhesion functions and mitochondrial metabolism. We further demonstrate that AS plays a role in vesicular trafficking and membrane organization. These AS transitions are enriched among targets of two RNA-binding proteins, Celf1 and Mbnl1, which undergo developmentally regulated changes in expression. Vesicular trafficking genes affected by AS during normal development (when Celf1 is downregulated) show a reversion to neonatal splicing patterns after Celf1 re-expression in adults. Short-term Celf1 induction in adult animals results in disrupted transverse tubule organization and calcium handling. These results identify potential roles for AS in multiple aspects of postnatal heart maturation, including vesicular trafficking and intracellular membrane dynamics.},

abstract = {During the formation of the brain, developing neurons are faced with a logistical problem. After newborn neurons form they must change in shape and move to their final location in the brain. Despite much speculation, little is known about these processes. Neurons mature via the activity of several pathways that control the activity, or expression, of the neuron{\textquoteright}s genes. One way of controlling such gene expression is through proteins called transcription factors. At the same time, the developing neurons go through a process called polarization, where different regions of the cell develop different characteristics. However, it was not known how the maturation and polarization processes are linked, or how the developing neurons actively regulate polarization. By studying the developing mouse brain, Singh et al. found that a transcription factor called Zeb1 keeps neurons in a immature state, stopping them from becoming polarized. Further investigation revealed that Zeb1 does this by preventing the production of a group of proteins that helps to polarize the cells. The most common type of malignant brain tumour in children is called a medulloblastoma. Singh et al. analyzed the genes expressed in mice that have a type of medulloblastoma that results from the constant activity of a gene called Sonic Hedgehog in developing neurons. This revealed that these tumour cells contain abnormally high levels of Zeb1, and so do not take on a polarized form. However, artificially restoring other factors that encourage the cells to polarize caused the neurons to mature normally. Further investigation is now needed to find out whether the activity of the Sonic Hedgehog gene regulates Zeb1 activity, and to discover whether inhibiting Zeb1 could prevent brain tumours from developing.},

A. Schematic of screening for TFs that induce hematopoiesis. First, add some TFs, then replate onto media with cytokines, grow for 14-19 days, then screen for GFP (marker of H2B, only expressed by immature HSCs.
B. Visual validation, showing that the 18 TFs did indeed transduce and induce HSC differentiation, as opposed to no TFs
C. One colony, showing GFP expression and probably differentiation. Morphological changes ... more circular??
D. Transduced MEFs to dfifferent media ?? Found that AFT024 had the best colony numbers so used it for the rest of the study.
E. Removed four TFS: Trib3, Bex2, Tcf3, and Hhex for 14 TFs and put onto media from (D). Found increases in absolute and GFP+ colony numbers
F. Transduced with PU.1 + CEBPalpha (macrophage-like cells) and did not see GFP activation (negative control)
G. Screend the removal of the remaining 14 factors to see if they affected growth. From here, selected 7: Gata2, Gfi1b, cFos, Etv6, Scl, Bmi1, and Runx1 [req'd for endothelial to hematopoeitic transition]

Figure 2.
A. Just the 7 TFs had larger colony numbers than the 14. Showed what happens when you remove one of the TFs.
B. From (A), chose two TFs to remove, then tried removing one more and found that Gfib1, Gata2, Cfos, and Etv6
C. FACS showing how much differentiation there is (more right --{\&}gt; more differentiation)

Figure 3.
A. RT-PCR of 100+f cells/well (what is LSK??) with different transductions. A dot indicates which TF was used. LSK=actual HSCs??  day 40 cells clustered with real HSCs
B. Expression of different markers during different days. blue highlight=day 20. Red histograms = emerging HSC markers. Endogenous TFs: brown

Figure 4.
A. FACS of the MEFs transduced with the four TFs, then checking for expression of Prom1 and Sca1 (markers of hematopoeisis??) 
B. % of population that are Prom1+ and GFP+
C. MEFs + 7TFS --{\&}gt; nonadherent cells
D. MEFs + 4 TFs --{\&}gt; GFP expression and see increases in CD45 and Tie2 expression as the days progress
E. MEFS + 4TFS --{\&}gt; gelatin (not the otehre media??) Looking at morphology. See small nonadherent GFP+ cells
F. Left, FACS and right, immunofluorescence of the cells with high GFP and high Prom1. Far right, the cells that they chose to have high GFP have really high GFP (not surprising....)

Figure 5.
A. Change in morphology after the addition of the 4 TFs
B. clustering of mRNA-Seq after transduction. replicates look like each other. Used NMF and consensus clsutering to find meta-genes that were highly expressed in one sampel over antoher.
C. PCA of mRNA-seq showing separation of the samples, then showed a "hypothetical trajectory" which doesn't make any sense
D. alignments of the mRNA seq reads (browser track) showing that only the differenaited cells aare expressing the proper markers, Ly6e, and CD45
E. Calculated FPKM for each marker, whoing that over time, these cells are becoming positive for HSC markers.
F. MEFS + 4TFs with GFP staining and CD49 (red) staining. CD49f+ is endothelial-like and GFP+CD49f+ staining is semi-adherent. Arrows, (a) endothelial like, and (b) semiadherent
G. FACS of CD49f+ in CD45+ and CD45- populations. Did a sequential FACS to get the cells that they want, which are CD45+ and CD49f+
H. No idea what this matrix is?? What are x and y axes?? Maybe they're trying to represent a network in a new way. Seems like a different way of doing gene/functional enrichment analysis
I. miRNAs that were supposed to be active in these cells based on TargetScan

abstract = {What does it take to convert a heap of sequencing data into a publishable result? First, common tools are employed to reduce primary data (sequencing reads) to a form suitable for further analyses (i.e., list of variable sites). The subsequent exploratory stage is much more ad hoc and requires development of custom scripts making it problematic for biomedical researchers. Here we describe a hybrid platform combining common analysis pathways with exploratory environments. It aims at fully encompassing and simplifying the {\textquotedblleft}raw data-to-publication{\textquotedblright} pathway and making it reproducible.},

abstract = {Herein, we review the epitope approach to vaccine development, and discuss how knowledge of HLA supertypes might be used as a tool in the development of such vaccines. After reviewing the main structural features of the A2-, A3-, B7-, and B44- supertype alleles, and biological data demonstrating their immunological relevance, we analyze the frequency at which these supertype alleles are expressed in various ethnicities and discuss the relevance of those observations to vaccine development. Next, the existence of five new supertypes (A1, A24, B27, B58, and B62) is reported. As a result, it is possible to account for the predominance of all known HLA class I with only nine main functional binding specificities. The practical implications of this finding, as well as its relevance to understanding the functional implication of MHC polymorphism in humans, are discussed.},

abstract = {To gain insight into the regulation of expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms, we have determined the structural organization of the mouse PPAR gamma (mPPAR gamma) gene. This gene extends > 105 kb and gives rise to two mRNAs (mPPAR gamma 1 and mPPAR gamma 2) that differ at their 5' ends. The mPPAR gamma 2 cDNA encodes an additional 30 amino acids N-terminal to the first ATG codon of mPPAR gamma 1 and reveals a different 5' untranslated sequence. We show that mPPAR gamma 1 mRNA is encoded by eight exons, whereas the mPPAR gamma 2 mRNA is encoded by seven exons. Most of the 5' untranslated sequence of mPPAR gamma 1 mRNA is encoded by two exons, whereas the 5' untranslated sequence and the extra 30 N-terminal amino acids of mPPAR gamma 2 are encoded by one exon, which is located between the second and third exons coding for mPPAR gamma 1. The last six exons of mPPAR gamma gene code for identical sequences in mPPAR gamma 1 and mPPAR gamma 2 isoforms. The mPPAR gamma 1 and mPPAR gamma 2 isoforms are transcribed from different promoters. The mPPAR gamma gene has been mapped to chromosome 6 E3-F1 by in situ hybridization using a biotin-labeled probe. These results establish that at least one of the PPAR genes yields more than one protein product, similar to that encountered with retinoid X receptor and retinoic acid receptor genes. The existence of multiple PPAR isoforms transcribed from different promoters could increase the diversity of ligand and tissue-specific transcriptional responses.},

This comparison integrated protein interaction and sequence information to reveal 71 network regions that were conserved across all three species and many exclusive to the metazoans. We used this conservation, and found statistically significant support for 4,645 previously undescribed protein functions and 2,609 previously undescribed protein interactions. We tested 60 interaction predictions for yeast by two-hybrid analysis, confirming approximately half of these. Significantly, many of the predicted functions and interactions would not have been identified from sequence similarity alone, demonstrating that network comparisons provide essential biological information beyond what is gleaned from the genome.},

We found that Msi genes are rarely mutated but frequently overexpressed in human cancers and are associated with an epithelial-luminal cell state. Using ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis, we found that Msi proteins regulate translation of genes implicated in epithelial cell biology and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promote an epithelial splicing pattern. Overexpression of Msi proteins inhibited the translation of Jagged1, a factor required for EMT, and repressed EMT in cell culture and in mammary gland in vivo. Knockdown of Msis in epithelial cancer cells promoted loss of epithelial identity. Our results show that mammalian Msi proteins contribute to an epithelial gene expression program in neural and mammary cell types.},

abstract = {As critical players in gene regulation, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are taking center stage in our understanding of cellular function and disease. In our era of bench-top sequencers and unprecedented computational power, biological questions can be addressed in a systematic, genome-wide manner. Development of high-throughput sequencing (Seq) methodologies provides unparalleled potential to discover new mechanisms of disease-associated perturbations of RNA homeostasis. Complementary to candidate single-gene studies, these innovative technologies may elicit the discovery of unexpected mechanisms, and enable us to determine the widespread influence of the multifunctional RBPs on their targets. Given that the disruption of RNA processing is increasingly implicated in neurological diseases, these approaches will continue to provide insights into the roles of RBPs in disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Defining the transcriptome, the repertoire of transcribed regions encoded in the genome, is a challenging experimental task. Current approaches, relying on sequencing of ESTs or cDNA libraries, are expensive and labor-intensive. Here, we present a general approach for ab initio discovery of the complete transcriptome of the budding yeast, based only on the unannotated genome sequence and millions of short reads from a single massively parallel sequencing run. Using novel algorithms, we automatically construct a highly accurate transcript catalog. Our approach automatically and fully defines 86% of the genes expressed under the given conditions, and discovers 160 previously undescribed transcription units of 250 bp or longer. It correctly demarcates the 5' and 3' UTR boundaries of 86 and 77% of expressed genes, respectively. The method further identifies 83% of known splice junctions in expressed genes, and discovers 25 previously uncharacterized introns, including 2 cases of condition-dependent intron retention. Our framework is applicable to poorly understood organisms, and can lead to greater understanding of the transcribed elements in an explored genome.},

abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is widely used by higher eukaryotes to generate different protein isoforms in specific cell or tissue types. To compare AS events across human tissues, we analyzed the splicing patterns of genomically aligned expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from libraries of cDNAs from different tissues.
Controlling for differences in EST coverage among tissues, we found that the brain and testis had the highest levels of exon skipping. The most pronounced differences between tissues were seen for the frequencies of alternative 3' splice site and alternative 5' splice site usage, which were about 50 to 100% higher in the liver than in any other human tissue studied. Quantifying differences in splice junction usage, the brain, pancreas, liver and the peripheral nervous system had the most distinctive patterns of AS. Analysis of available microarray expression data showed that the liver had the most divergent pattern of expression of serine-arginine protein and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein genes compared to the other human tissues studied, possibly contributing to the unusually high frequency of alternative splice site usage seen in liver. Sequence motifs enriched in alternative exons in genes expressed in the brain, testis and liver suggest specific splicing factors that may be important in AS regulation in these tissues.
This study distinguishes the human brain, testis and liver as having unusually high levels of AS, highlights differences in the types of AS occurring commonly in different tissues, and identifies candidate cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors likely to have important roles in tissue-specific AS in human cells.},

abstract = {The AC40 and AC19 subunits (encoded by RPC40 and RPC19) are shared by yeast RNA polymerases I and III and have a local sequence similarity to prokaryotic alpha subunits. Mutational analysis of the corresponding "alpha motif" indicated that its integrity is essential on AC40 subunit but is not essential on AC19 subunit. By applying the two-hybrid method, these two polypeptides were shown to associate in vivo. Extragenic suppression of rpc19 and rpc40 mutations confirmed that AC19 and AC40 subunits interact with each other in vivo and revealed an interaction with ABC10 beta subunit [encoded by RPB10; Woychick, N. A. {\&} Young, R.A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17816-17819], one of the five polypeptides common to all three nuclear RNA polymerases. A correction of the RPB10 sequence showed that ABC10 beta subunit is a 70-amino acid polypeptide, as confirmed by peptide microsequencing. These results suggest that the assembly of RNA polymerase I and III requires the association of ABC10 beta subunit with an AC19/AC40 heterodimer.},

abstract = {Gene activation in eukaryotes requires chromatin remodeling complexes like Swi/Snf and histone acetylases like SAGA. How these factors are recruited to promoters is not yet understood. Using CHIP, we measured recruitment of Swi/Snf, SAGA, the repressor Ash1p, and transcription factors Swi5p and SBF to the HO endonuclease promoter as cells progress through the yeast cell cycle. Swi5p's entry into nuclei at the end of anaphase recruits Swi/Snf, which then recruits SAGA. These two factors then facilitate SBF's binding. Ash1p, which only accumulates in daughter cell nuclei, binds to HO soon after Swi5p and aborts recruitment of Swi/Snf, SAGA, and SBF. Swi5p remains at HO for only 5 min. Swi/Snf's and SAGA's subsequent persistence at HO is self sustaining and constitutes an "epigenetic memory" of HO's transient interaction with Swi5p.},

Recent years have brought new insights into the intricate regulation of P-TEFb function and its relationship with Tat, revealing novel mechanisms for controlling HIV transcription and fueling new efforts to overcome the barrier of transcriptional latency in eradicating HIV. Moreover, the improved understanding of HIV and Tat forms a basis for studying transcription elongation control in general. Here, we review advances in HIV transcription research with a focus on the growing family of cellular P-TEFb complexes, structural insights into the interactions between Tat, P-TEFb, and TAR RNA, and the multifaceted regulation of these interactions by posttranscriptional modifications of Tat.},

abstract = {Cell microarrays are a promising tool for performing large-scale functional genomic screening in mammalian cells at reasonable cost, but owing to technical limitations they have been restricted for use with a narrow range of cell lines and short-term assays. Here, we describe MicroSCALE (Microarrays of Spatially Confined Adhesive Lentiviral Features), a cell microarray-based platform that enables application of this technology to a wide range of cell types and longer-term assays. We used MicroSCALE to uncover kinases that when overexpressed partially desensitized B-RAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells to inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) RAF, the MAPKKs MEK1 and 2 (MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2), mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), or PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). These screens indicated that cells treated with inhibitors acting through common mechanisms were affected by a similar profile of overexpressed proteins. In contrast, screens involving inhibitors acting through distinct mechanisms yielded unique profiles, a finding that has potential relevance for small-molecule target identification and combination drugging studies. Further, by integrating large-scale functional screening results with cancer cell line gene expression and pharmacological sensitivity data, we validated the nuclear factor $\kappa$B pathway as a potential mediator of resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. The MicroSCALE platform described here may enable new classes of large-scale, resource-efficient screens that were not previously feasible, including those involving combinations of cell lines, perturbations, and assay outputs or those involving limited numbers of cells and limited or expensive reagents.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of the commonly used progressive multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly improved for the alignment of divergent protein sequences. Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. These modifications are incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is freely available.},

abstract = {The development of T cell effector and memory responses against foreign antigens (Ags) involves the activation, differentiation and proliferation of naive T cells expressing distinct Ag-specific TCRs. Understanding the complexity of Ag-selected TCR repertoires in individual responders in terms of the sequences selected and their relative frequencies may provide indications about how a repertoire is established and suggest ways to influence the outcome of an immune response. Most methods of repertoire analysis are unsuitable for calculating the relative in vivo frequencies of Ag-specific clones (expressing distinct TCRs) selected during an immune response, whereas sequence data obtained by single-cell PCR analysis directly reflect cell frequencies if a sufficiently large number of cells is sampled. Using a CD8 T cell response in normal mice in which Ag-selected cells are identified by cell surface phenotype and rearranged TCRBV sequences are determined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA directly from single cells, we have analyzed a large number (>200 per animal) of structurally-related Ag-specific TCRs to calculate the frequencies of distinct TCRs selected by individual mice. We found that each responder selects a unique Ag-specific TCR repertoire in which the various TCRBV sequences are present in a wide range of frequencies. However, the overall distribution of sequences is quite similar for different responder animals. Moreover, an individual's selected TCR repertoire is uniformly represented among Ag-specific CD8 cells circulating in the blood or localized in the spleen or liver. Relatively few sequences make up the bulk of the repertoire and account for the oligoclonality observed in earlier studies. We discuss various models that could account for this skewed distribution of an Ag-selected TCR repertoire.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry is a widely used analytical technique for examining microscopic particles, such as cells. The Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) was developed in 1984 for storing flow data and it is supported by all instrument and third party software vendors. However, FCS does not capture the full scope of flow cytometry (FCM)-related data and metadata, and data standards have recently been developed to address this shortcoming. The Data Standards Task Force (DSTF) of the International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) has developed several data standards to complement the raw data encoded in FCS files. Efforts started with the Minimum Information about a Flow Cytometry Experiment, a minimal data reporting standard of details necessary to include when publishing FCM experiments to facilitate third party understanding. MIFlowCyt is now being recommended to authors by publishers as part of manuscript submission, and manuscripts are being checked by reviewers and editors for compliance. Gating-ML was then introduced to capture gating descriptions - an essential part of FCM data analysis describing the selection of cell populations of interest. The Classification Results File Format was developed to accommodate results of the gating process, mostly within the context of automated clustering. Additionally, the Archival Cytometry Standard bundles data with all the other components describing experiments. Here, we introduce these recent standards and provide the very first example of how they can be used to report FCM data including analysis and results in a standardized, computationally exchangeable form. Reporting standards and open file formats are essential for scientific collaboration and independent validation. The recently developed FCM data standards are now being incorporated into third party software tools and data repositories, which will ultimately facilitate understanding and data reuse.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare but life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Recently, strong associations of HLA-B*1502 and HLA-B*5801 with carbamazepine- and allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions were found in Han Chinese patients, respectively, but ethnic differences in the associations have been reported. The objective of this study is to clarify the involvement of HLA-B*1502 and HLA-B*5801 in Japanese SJS/TEN patients.

METHODS:HLA-B genotyping was performed on 58 Japanese SJS/TEN patients between July 2006 and April 2008 from multicenters in Japan.

RESULTS:There were no HLA-B*1502 carriers among 58 SJS/TEN patients. This patient group included seven carbamazepine-related and 11 aromatic anti-epileptic agent-related SJS/TEN patients. In addition, there were five HLA-B*5801 carriers, which included four allopurinol-related SJS/TEN patients.

CONCLUSION:While HLA-B*1502 is unlikely to be associated with carbamazepine-related or aromatic anti-epileptic agent-related SJS/TEN, HLA-B*5801 was significantly associated with allopurinol-related SJS/TEN in Japanese.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:During the past decade, new classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and their unexpected functions were discovered. Stable secondary structure is the key feature of many non-coding RNAs. Taking into account huge amounts of genomic data, development of computational methods to survey genomes for structured RNAs remains an actual problem, especially when homologous sequences are not available for comparative analysis. Existing programs scan genomes with a fixed window by efficiently constructing a matrix of RNA minimum free energies. A wide range of lengths of structured RNAs necessitates the use of many different window lengths that substantially increases the output size and computational efforts.

RESULTS:In this article, we present an algorithm RNASurface to efficiently scan genomes by constructing a matrix of significance of RNA secondary structures and to identify all locally optimal structured RNA segments up to a predefined size. RNASurface significantly improves precision of identification of known ncRNA in Bacillus subtilis.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:RNASurface C source code is available from http://bioinf.fbb.msu.ru/RNASurface/downloads.html.},

abstract = {In this article, we provide evidence that a frequent source of diversity between mammalian transcripts occurs as a consequence of species-specific alternative splicing (AS) of conserved exons. Using a highly predictive computational method, we estimate that >11% of human and mouse cassette alternative exons undergo skipping in one species but constitutively splicing in the other. These species-specific AS events are predicted to modify conserved domains in proteins more frequently than other classes of AS events. The results thus provide evidence that species-specific AS of conserved exons constitutes an additional potential source of complexity and species-specific differences between mammals.},

abstract = {We demonstrate an integrated approach to build, test, and refine a model of a cellular pathway, in which perturbations to critical pathway components are analyzed using DNA microarrays, quantitative proteomics, and databases of known physical interactions. Using this approach, we identify 997 messenger RNAs responding to 20 systematic perturbations of the yeast galactose-utilization pathway, provide evidence that approximately 15 of 289 detected proteins are regulated posttranscriptionally, and identify explicit physical interactions governing the cellular response to each perturbation. We refine the model through further iterations of perturbation and global measurements, suggesting hypotheses about the regulation of galactose utilization and physical interactions between this and a variety of other metabolic pathways.},

LV = left ventricle or lentivirus???

This paper has a stark contrast in the writing style between the main text and the discussion. The discussion is clear, well organized, and provides a compelling summary of results. The main text is just jumbled...

Figure 1.
<b>A.</b> After damaging the heart using isoproterenol (ISO), the authors measured new cell formation (how?? doesn't seem like BrdU because the fractions are too small compared to figure 1C.). The x-axis indicates number of days after ISO damage, and the y-axis shows the number of endogenous Cardiac Stem Cells (eCSC) cells per million cardiomyocytes at this time point. They point out that on day 3, there is about an 8x increase in eCSCs, with all their modifications, and while the quantity decreases, we still see a larger number of cells after ISO treatment, even after 28 days.
<b>B. </b>Similar to A, though quantifying the number of cells based on the cell cycle. Quiescent cells are in G0, and as you can see in the control, about 93% of the cells are in G0/G1. But after ISO treatment, the authors found that a larger proportion of cells entered S, the DNA replicative phase, and G2, the expansion phase of the cell cycle, indicating that these cells are no longer quiescent.
<b>C. </b>After ISO treatment, the authors looked at which cells were BrdU positive, indicating active transcription.
<b>D.</b> Confocal microscopy of mouse heart sections day 3 after ISO treatment. Nkx2.5 are cardiac lineage TFs, and they're showing that the eCSCs are differentiating. (control image?? - looks like there's some Nkx2.5 action in the cardiomyocytes - is this expected?)
<b>E.</b> Quantification of the number of c-kit and Nkx2.5 postiive Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPCs). They point out that increasesd 4fold at the max, and the number of cells per million cardiomyocytes stayed above the control even after 28 days
F. Confocal microscopy of mouse heart sections, showing transcriptionally active cells (mitotic) after day 28. Mostly mononucleated (unlike mature cardiomyocytes, which have multiple nuclei)
G. Ki67 = marker of immature, proliferative CMs (Ki67 protein associated with proliferation)
<b>H and I.</b> Increase in the number of proliferating cells
<b>J. </b>Confocal microscopy with Cnx43, which indicates formation of gap junctions which show integration of the newly formed CM with the rest of the myocardium.
<b>K.</b> Rod-shaped (more like mature CMs) CMs that are BrdU positive detected from ISO-treated hearts, indicating mature proliferation into cardiac lineage.
<b>L. </b>Size of cardiomyocytes. Since they're small, we know they're not fully mature.

Figure 2. 
A. Schematic of transgenic mouse crosses. Besides 80% of cardiomyocytes, all other cells should be beta-galactose positive.The point is to get green mature cardiomyocytes, either mature or maturING cells commited to the cardiomyocyte lineage. Because they want to see if the new cells are green, that means that existing cardiomyocytes de-differentiated and repaired the heart, but if the new cells are blue and beta-galactose positive, then that means the cells are coming from somewhere else.
B. Histology staining of GFP and beta-galactose. They're trying to show that after ISO treatment, there is an increase in beta-galactose positive cells.
C. Same as B, but quantified as a percentage of the labeled cardiomyocytes.
D. Confocal microscopy of mouse heart sections, showing increase of BrdU in beta-galactose positive cells primarly (control image with GFP stain?)
E. percentage of BrdU positive myocytes. Y-axis really small! And where is GFP?
F. Confocal staining of single cardiomyocytes. Only see BrdU positive cells as not YFP-postiive (Does this mean they are coming from not existing cardiomyocytes? Why did they need to do this in addition to the previous model? what does this mean?). Also these are mononucleated.
G. Replaced bone marrow of mice with GFP labeled bone marrow of other mice. FACS of GFP-positive and FL2-H which is the highest fluorescent signal found in the cell. THis finds cells where the GFP is higher than the underlying fluorescent signal. Could find some mature CMs that were GFP positive. 
H. CTN1 = cardiac troponin 1 (side note: this paper sucks because they don't explain abbrevs like cTn1). Cardiac regulatory protein specific to myocardium. Claim that they couldn't find any BM-derived cells that were GFP positive AND BrdU positive. But this section looks like it has some (lower left)
I. Percent of total myocyte nuclei that were BrdU positive and either GFP negative or GFP positive. But doesn't this show that there are a bunch of cells that are BRdU positive and GFP+?

Figure 3. 
A. Schematic for a system (sorry I didn't understand the details) that creates mice where when c-kit positive eCSC cells in the myocardium take in the lentivirus, the cells turn yellow.
B. (left) FACS of YFP vs c-kit, showing that with the empty lentivirus, there are no cells expressing YFP.
B. (middle) FACS of YFP vs c-kit of total peripheral blood cells and bone marrow cells, showing that with the lentivirus, about 35% of them are yellow.
B. (right) FACS of YFP vs c-kit of only cardiac apex cells, showing that with the lentivirus, about 65% of them are YFP-positive.
C. (left) FACS of YFP vs "isotype control" (non specific binding of antibody)
C. (middle) FACS of YFP vs cTn1, showing that 98% of fixed CM cells are cTn1 positive and YFP negative. (shouldn't they be consistent across these panels and show fixed, fixed, or unfixed, unfixed?)
C. (right) FACS of YFP vs cTn1, shwoing that 0% of unfixed CMs also express YFP
D. Confocal microscopy of cardiomyocytes with eCSCs labeled with YFP. Very little YFP.
E. Now they treated the YFP mice with ISO. Quantification of myocytes that are brdU positive vs YFP positive, which they claim means that these CMs are from the c-kit positive eCSCs.
F. MHC = myosin heavy chain. Shows that there is a new cardiomyocyte, as labeled by the BrdU and that this new CM is also positive for YFP.
G. alpha-SA = alpha-sarcomeric actin. Single cells, showing that these are indeed cardiomyocytes using a different CM marker.
H. always have YFP on x and cTn1 on y???
(top) very little YFP in mice not treated with ISO
(middle) some YFP in the blood(?) of the mice treated with ISO
(bottom) a little more YFP in mice treated with ISO, in their cardiac apex
I. microarrays of gene expression. Only showing genes with log fold change {\&}gt;1 (isn't it usually 2? - no I'm thinking of log2 fold change. didn't specify log2 ln, log10???). Want to show that the YFP CMs have a similar gene expression profile with the adult CMs.
J. Some select genes, specifically YfpCMs don't completely switch over from using Rbl-1 to Rb1, which indicates they have not compltely exited the cell cycle.

Figure 4. Does the ISO-injured microenvironment of the heart **attract** eCSCs?
A. A clone of GFP-tagged c-kit positive CSCs that would be injected into the tail vein of rats, 12 hours after ISO injury. Control: injected with c-kit negative cardiac cells (minus cardiomyocytes)
B. After ISO treatement, more CSCs were detected in teh myocardium than the MDCCs
C. ALmost no MDCCs in the my ocardium (how many days after treatment?)
D. Amost no CSCs in the myocardium of CTRL samples
E. (1 day after ISO) Lots of CSCs in myocardium
F. (6 days after ISO) lots of CSCs in myocardium
G. (28 dats after ISO) high Ki67 (proliferation)
H. (28 days after ISO) well developed sarcomeres, but still smaller than adults
I. SDF1 is upregulated in CMs after ISO, SDF1 is involved in mobilization of stem cells.
J and K. When you interfere with SDF-1 or CXCR4, then the CSCs have a harder time getting into the myocardium. Dependent on SDF-1 and CXCR4 individually.

Figure 5.
A. After injecting the antimitotic agent 5-flurouracil (5-FU), saw far fewere c-kit positive eCSCs (in the myocardium??)
B. After injecting with 5-FU, saw far less mitotic activation as well (ki67 marker)
C. Less formation of CMs?? Bottom right panel, less long cells. more heart failure??
D. Fractional shortening?? How much less space there is between the valleys of the echocardiogram vs the peaks. Less in ISO-treated 5-FU (heart failure)

Figure 6. Trying to see if adding eCSCs will gain back the ability to restore cardiomyocytes when you've taken the endogenous ability away. This is a pretty good figure
A. Treated mice with ISO, then 3 days later with 5-FU, then injected with either CSCs (significance of TK?) or c-Fibroblasts. They want to turn off some of the CSCs after 2 months, or keep them on (via Ganciclovir, GCV) Are the days indicating how long each step is, or the total time?
B. LVEDP = Left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Treating with Saline or Fibroblasts looked the same - had heart failure either way. After treating with GCV, also saw heart failure as in Saline/c-Fibro
C. LVIDd = Left Ventricular Internal Dimension-Diastole
D. (top) Number of c-kit positive myocardial cells per 10^6 myocytes. Lots more in CSC, but goes away after treating with GCV
D. (bottom) Only see newly generated GFP myocytes (but isn't this expected caues the other mice don't have GFP in the first place?)
E. See c-kit positive and GFP-positive CSCs in rat myocardium (2 months) "chimeric hearts"
F. eCSC pool now 90% GFP
G. Full integration of the CMs into the myocardium
H. single cell microscopy showing full sarcomeric development. rod-shaped GFP+ cells

Figure 7. This is the worst figure...
A. eCSCs pulled out of the rat had similar clonogenesis as the original eCSCs put into the rat.
B. These cells can also be clonal
C. Similar clonogenesis of parental CSCs and re-isolated CSCs
D. Larger image of cardiospheres???
E. qtPCR quantifying mRNA of parental and reisolated CSCs and cardio markers
F. (european decimals on y..) GAHH THE ZEBRASSS and the vibrationnnnnnnnnn. just use varying shades of grey... Anyways there are similar levels of mRNA of these four factors regardless of the number of passages.
G. CSCs as a cardiosphere
[for the following, shouldn't they show a control image of what they're supposed to look like? or is the audience all muscle/heart experts?]
H. CSCs differentaited into cardiomyocytes
I. CSCs differentiated into smooth muscle
J. CSCs differentiated into endothelial cells
[ so why do they differentiate into other stuff too??]
K-L. using the metrics as before, parental vs reisolated CSCs were identical and restored heart function just teh same.
M and N. new GFP+ CMs
O. GFP+ arteries
P. GFP+ capilaries

abstract = {Flow cytometry bioinformatics is the application of bioinformatics to flow cytometry data, which involves storing, retrieving, organizing, and analyzing flow cytometry data using extensive computational resources and tools. Flow cytometry bioinformatics requires extensive use of and contributes to the development of techniques from computational statistics and machine learning . Flow cytometry and related methods allow the quantification of multiple independent biomarkers on large numbers of single cells . The rapid growth in the multidimensionality and throughput of flow cytometry data, particularly in the 2000s, has led to the creation of a variety of computational analysis methods, data standards, and public databases for the sharing of results. Computational methods exist to assist in the preprocessing of flow cytometry data, identifying cell populations within it, matching those cell populations across samples, and performing diagnosis and discovery using the results of previous steps. For preprocessing, this includes compensating for spectral overlap, transforming data onto scales conducive to visualization and analysis, assessing data for quality, and normalizing data across samples and experiments. For population identification, tools are available to aid traditional manual identification of populations in two-dimensional scatter plots (gating), to use dimensionality reduction to aid gating, and to find populations automatically in higher dimensional space in a variety of ways. It is also possible to characterize data in more comprehensive ways, such as the density-guided binary space partitioning technique known as probability binning, or by combinatorial gating. Finally, diagnosis using flow cytometry data can be aided by supervised learning techniques, and discovery of new cell types of biological importance by high-throughput statistical methods, as part of pipelines incorporating all of the aforementioned methods. Open standards , data , and software are also key parts of flow cytometry bioinformatics. Data standards include the widely adopted Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) defining how data from cytometers should be stored, but also several new standards under development by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) to aid in storing more detailed information about experimental design and analytical steps. Open data is slowly growing with the opening of the CytoBank database in 2010 and FlowRepository in 2012, both of which allow users to freely distribute their data, and the latter of which has been recommended as the preferred repository for MIFlowCyt-compliant data by ISAC. Open software is most widely available in the form of a suite of Bioconductor packages, but is also available for web execution on the GenePattern platform.},

abstract = {With a rapidly growing pool of known tertiary structures, the importance of protein structure comparison parallels that of sequence alignment. We have developed a novel algorithm (DALI) for optimal pairwise alignment of protein structures. The three-dimensional co-ordinates of each protein are used to calculate residue-residue (C alpha-C alpha) distance matrices. The distance matrices are first decomposed into elementary contact patterns, e.g. hexapeptide-hexapeptide submatrices. Then, similar contact patterns in the two matrices are paired and combined into larger consistent sets of pairs. A Monte Carlo procedure is used to optimize a similarity score defined in terms of equivalent intramolecular distances. Several alignments are optimized in parallel, leading to simultaneous detection of the best, second-best and so on solutions. The method allows sequence gaps of any length, reversal of chain direction and free topological connectivity of aligned segments. Sequential connectivity can be imposed as an option. The method is fully automatic and identifies structural resemblances and common structural cores accurately and sensitively, even in the presence of geometrical distortions. An all-against-all alignment of over 200 representative protein structures results in an objective classification of known three-dimensional folds in agreement with visual classifications. Unexpected topological similarities of biological interest have been detected, e.g. between the bacterial toxin colicin A and globins, and between the eukaryotic POU-specific DNA-binding domain and the bacterial lambda repressor.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:A common difficulty in large-scale microarray studies is the presence of confounding factors, which may significantly skew estimates of statistical significance, cause unreliable feature selection and high false negative rates. To deal with these difficulties, an algorithmic framework known as Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA) was recently proposed.

RESULTS:Based on the notion that data can be viewed as an interference pattern, reflecting the superposition of independent effects and random noise, we present a modified SVA, called Independent Surrogate Variable Analysis (ISVA), to identify features correlating with a phenotype of interest in the presence of potential confounding factors. Using simulated data, we show that ISVA performs well in identifying confounders as well as outperforming methods which do not adjust for confounding. Using four large-scale Illumina Infinium DNA methylation datasets subject to low signal to noise ratios and substantial confounding by beadchip effects and variable bisulfite conversion efficiency, we show that ISVA improves the identifiability of confounders and that this enables a framework for feature selection that is more robust to model misspecification and heterogeneous phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate similar improvements of ISVA across four mRNA expression datasets. Thus, ISVA should be useful as a feature selection tool in studies that are subject to confounding.

AVAILABILITY:An R-package isva is available from www.cran.r-project.org.},

A. Left, Lgr4 expression (coupled with LacZ, and beta-galactosidase added) widespread throughout intestinal crypt. Right, Lgr5 only in stem cells. Knockout of either of these is lethal in mice.
B. 
Q: What is the difference between "fl" and "fx" ?
negative control??? Only state the Lgr5 fl/fl looks like control but don't show it. Day 5 post infection mouse crypts
Left, Stained for Ki67, a protein marker of proliferation.
Right, Olfactomedin4 is a stem cell marker.
Top, Lgr5 fl/fl claims to be the same as neg control but don't show it.
Left, Lgr4 fx/fx
Top, no effect compared to control (they say)
Middle, Lgr4 fl/fl shows fewer stem cells
Bottom, some "escaper" crypts but overall no stem cells in intestinal epithelium.

Figure 2.
A. Microarray , log2 ratio of APc fl/fl vs WT. Heatmap of the 306 genes downreg after Lgr4/5 del in vivo. Most of these are upregulated in Deletion of APC in comparison to wt. Honestly wouldn't trust this method. I like the GSEA better :)
B. Treated with Rspo1 (Wnt agonist), then removed it in vivo.
C. Same as B, but in in vitro organoid.
D. GSEA of all genes in the Apc deleted vs wt mouse comparison. Gene set = Lgr4/5 gene set.
E, F. GSEA of 306 (B) or 220 (C) genes in the universe of Rspo1+/- genes

Figure 3.
Used shRNAs against 3' UTR of LGR4. Whaat is TOPFLASH? get more signal if there is more WNT? BUt what about the Wnt3A stuff?
Also tried rescuing with Lgr4/5/6 rescu constructs. Less rescue with Lgr5 and 6. No rescue with Lgr1, 7 or 8 (supp figures)

Figure 4.
A. What is protein G??? Why does it capture only Lgt4/5/6 with any amount?
Lysate, things that did not stick to the Protein G beads. (I think??)
B. Surface Plasmon Resonance showing interaction of anti-flag AB with RPSO1-FH (double-tagged human RPSO1) Anti-flag has increased interaction when LGR5-exo-Fc (human IgG-Fc fusino with Lgr5). Shows direct physical contact. Noggin-fc, neg control. Positive control!?!?!?

Figure 5.
A. Organoids, days after tamoxifen treatment. Middle, mutant without Lgr5 and Lgr4. If add CHIR99201 (activates Wnt cascade), then rescue organoids
B. Same as above, but used actual Wnt

A. Schematic of the cells they're interested in.
IFE: interfollicular epidermis
JZ: junctional zone (formed during devel from Lrig1 cells, maintained by Blmp1 cells)
Infund:
Lrig1/Plet1
Blimp1
HF: Hair follicle
SG: Sebatious gland
Bulge: HF-SC niche
Gli1
Lgr5
CDK34/K19
Lgr6
B. Lrig1 protein expression (other allelic copy?)
C. Lrig1-EGFP protein expression
D. Lrig1 and Lrig-EGFP overlap almost exactly
E. at resting phase of HF cycle, Lrig1 expressed in cells in upper isthmus and SG that are not CD34+ve.
F. Histogram of FACS sorted on Sca1 expression, on Lrig1-EGFP cells. Lrig1-EGFP cells express less Sca1 than cells of IFE
G. Growth (anagen) phase of HF cycle, Lrig1 co-expressed with Lgr5
H. Lrig1 co-expressed with Plet-1 in upper pilosebaceous unit (one of many SC populations)
I. Expression of Lgr6 more widespread, fond in IFE, HF-SC, and SG, and isthmus 
J. Blimp1-expressing cells are different from Lrig1-EGFP expressing cells, and also have a different morphology
K. qPCR analysis showing that Lrig1+ cells and Cd34+ cells do not express high levels of Blimp1. And Lrig1 and Plet1/MTS24 are coexpressed in these cells as well.

Figure 2.
A. Schematic of isolated population
B. FACs sorting of how they gated on expression of Lrig1-GFP and CD34-PE
C. Performed "transcriptional analysis" (microarrays), then PCA showing that these populations are distinct. (variance explained by each PC??)
D. Hierarchical clustering of the microarray genes showing strong within-group simliarity
E. overlap of differentially expressed genes. Makes sense that CD34 vs neg is the biggest difference since these populations were totally separate on the FACS sorting. They state "A vast number of genes are enriched in the CD34-expressing component" but that's how they set up their experiment in the first place so......
F. Ki67+ cells in Lrig1 expressing compartment
G. Did BrdU pulses, and it was most incorporated by GFP+ cells (though look at the axes... still less than 5% so I wouldn't call that "highly proliferative")

Figure 3.
A. Lrig1 KI mouse crossed with Rosa25-Isl-tdTomato mice. Adminster tamoxifen, then get cells expressing Lrig1 at that moment will also have tdTomato. Quantification of the grouping of cells labeled with tdTomato, whether they appeared alone or with one or more friends.
B. Distribution of Lrig1+ labeled clones in the different areas of the skin. Proportion remains fairly constant over time. Does the "/" mean division or "or"? And the "+" is definitely an "and" ?
C-G. Migration of the Lrig1 cells throughout time. As time goes on, these cells fill out the infundibulum, and don't go into the IFE.
H. See migration of Lrig+ tdTomato cells into both the infundibulum AND the sebaceous gland
I, J. tdTomato detected in ONLY sebaceous gland
K, L. Initially, Lrig1+ cells were negative for Blimp1, but eventually some of them were positive, which supports the idea that Blimp1 is expressed by terminally differentiated sebatocytes..... Thus Lrig1+ cells contribute only to the infundibulum or the SG
M. Lineage tracing of mice with Lgr5-EGFP-ires-CreERT2 and K19CreEr. Dates: times after treating with tamoxifen to get a snapshot of what's currently expressing Lgr5 or K19. Again, only see cells labeled with these markers in lower part of pilosebaceous unit and not in IFE.

Figure 4. What is the role of these stem cells in wound repair?
A.-C Radial appearance of wound, staining for Lrig1, and see migration of the Lrig1 cells into the wound site.
D-F. After 10 months, what other kinds of markers are expressed by the cells nearby?
G-I. Also see radial distribution with Lgr5
J-L. Progeny of cells retained up to 1 year.
M. After wounding, far fewer cells remain
N.  Lrig1+ cells appear 200um+ away from where they were originally
O. Lrg5 (HF-SC) cells stay mostly in their lower pilosebaceous unit.
P-R. Lrig1+ cells appear and stay in IFE weeks and months after wounding. But Lgr5 cells come, up too but they're delayed in their response.

Figure 5. Wound as the recruitment event in tumor formation.
A. Mouse model with constitutive Kras activation (G12D) Percent of the mouse cohort that had tumors on lip or back.
B. In lip tumors, Lrig1 was found in the pilosebaceous unit and not in the IFE
C. Proliferative cells in the tumor
D,E. Fate-mapping of tdTomato (Lrg1+) showed cells first in upper isthmus, but then in IFE and infundibula, like in a wound.
F. Just treating with TPA doesn't create tumors.
G. Kras mutated mice were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which stimmulates inflammatory response, including driving Lrig1-expressing cells into IFE.
H. Kras+"full thickness wounding" --{\&}gt; tumors, and Lrig1+ cell migration to IFE.

abstract = {Previous investigations of the core gene regulatory circuitry that controls the pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells have largely focused on the roles of transcription, chromatin and non-coding RNA regulators. Alternative splicing represents a widely acting mode of gene regulation, yet its role in regulating ES-cell pluripotency and differentiation is poorly understood. Here we identify the muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and direct negative regulators of a large program of cassette exon alternative splicing events that are differentially regulated between ES cells and other cell types. Knockdown of MBNL proteins in differentiated cells causes switching to an ES-cell-like alternative splicing pattern for approximately half of these events, whereas overexpression of MBNL proteins in ES cells promotes differentiated-cell-like alternative splicing patterns. Among the MBNL-regulated events is an ES-cell-specific alternative splicing switch in the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1 that controls pluripotency. Consistent with a central and negative regulatory role for MBNL proteins in pluripotency, their knockdown significantly enhances the expression of key pluripotency genes and the formation of induced pluripotent stem cells during somatic cell reprogramming.},

abstract = {A protein is defined as an indexed string of elements at each level in the hierarchy of protein structure: sequence, secondary structure, super-secondary structure, etc. The elements, for example, residues or secondary structure segments such as helices or beta-strands, are associated with a series of properties and can be involved in a number of relationships with other elements. Element-by-element dissimilarity matrices are then computed and used in the alignment procedure based on the sequence alignment algorithm of Needleman {\&} Wunsch, expanded by the simulated annealing technique to take into account relationships as well as properties. The utility of this method for exploring the variability of various aspects of protein structure and for comparing distantly related proteins is demonstrated by multiple alignment of serine proteinases, aspartic proteinase lobes and globins.},

abstract = {Despite their importance, the molecular circuits that control the differentiation of naive T cells remain largely unknown. Recent studies that reconstructed regulatory networks in mammalian cells have focused on short-term responses and relied on perturbation-based approaches that cannot be readily applied to primary T cells. Here we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution, novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based perturbation tools to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic regulatory network that controls the differentiation of mouse TH17 cells, a proinflammatory T-cell subset that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. The TH17 transcriptional network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, the coupled action of which may be essential for maintaining the balance between TH17 and other CD4(+) T-cell subsets. Our study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and reveals its organizational principles; it also highlights novel drug targets for controlling TH17 cell differentiation.},

abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in characterizing epidermal stem cells by microarray analysis of FACS-selected populations. One limitation of this approach is that the gene expression profiles represent the average of the cell population, potentially masking cellular heterogeneity of functional significance. To overcome this problem, we have performed single-cell expression profiling. We have generated cDNA libraries from single human epidermal cells, designated as stem or transit-amplifying cells on the basis of Delta1 and melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression. Of the 14 putative stem cell markers identified, we selected one, the EGF receptor antagonist leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (Lrig1), for further study. Lrig1 was expressed in groups of basal cells in human interfollicular epidermis previously identified as enriched for stem cells. Overexpression of Lrig1 decreased keratinocyte proliferation but did not affect the proportion of stem and transit-amplifying cells, as judged by clonal growth characteristics. Down-regulation of Lrig1 using siRNA increased cell-surface EGF receptor levels, enhanced activation of downstream pathways, and stimulated proliferation. Lrig1 acted in part by negatively regulating the Myc promoter. We propose that Lrig1 maintains epidermal stem cells in a quiescent nondividing state, and that Lrig1 down-regulation triggers proliferation.},

abstract = {Cytoscape is an open source software project for integrating biomolecular interaction networks with high-throughput expression data and other molecular states into a unified conceptual framework. Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

abstract = {Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare but severe drug reaction, most commonly to aromatic anticonvulsants with a delayed onset, variable clinical presentation and protracted course. The exact incidence of DRESS syndrome is not known because of the variability in clinical presentation, lack of strict diagnostic criteria and universally accepted nomenclature. We report four cases of DRESS syndrome associated with the use of carbamazepine. The clinical manifestation was similar: a maculopapular eruption progressing to exfoliative erythroderma, fever, and lymphadenopathy. Leukocytosis, atypical lymphocytes and liver injury (in 2 patients) were also observed. Assessment of causality using the Naranjo algorithm established a "probable" relationship with carbamazepine in three of the cases and a "possible" relationship in one case. Detection of DRESS syndrome is dependent on the exclusion of a variety of diseases with similar manifestations and may be delayed in time. DRESS syndrome is a potentially life-threatening multisystem adverse drug reaction, and accidental reexposure or drug provocation tests must be avoided.},

abstract = {Clinical grade Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only described in humans. Recent imaging studies in early AD patients showed that the parietal areas display the most prominent metabolic impairments. So far, neuroimaging studies have not been able to explain why the medial parietal regions possess this hub characteristic in AD. Paleoneurological and neuroanatomical studies suggest that our species, Homo sapiens, has a unique and derived organization of the parietal areas, which are involved in higher cognitive functions. Combining evidence from neuroimaging, paleontology, and comparative anatomy, we suggest that the vulnerability of the parietal lobe to neurodegenerative processes may be associated with the origin of our species. The species-specific parietal morphology in modern humans largely influenced the brain spatial organization, and it involved changes in vascularization and energy management, which may underlie the sensitivity of these areas to metabolic impairment. Metabolic constraints and anatomical evolutionary changes in the medial parietal regions of modern humans may be important in early AD onset. Taking into account the species-specific adaptations of the modern human parietal areas and their association with AD, we hypothesize that AD can be the evolutionary drawback of the specialized structure of our parietal lobes. The cognitive advantage is associated with increased sensitivity to neurodegenerative processes which, being limited to the post-reproductive period, have a minor effect on the overall genetic fitness. The changes of energy requirements associated with form and size variations at the parietal areas may support the hypothesis of AD as a metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Hematopoiesis culminates in the production of functionally heterogeneous blood cell types. In zebrafish, the lack of cell surface antibodies has compelled researchers to use fluorescent transgenic reporter lines to label specific blood cell fractions. However, these approaches are limited by the availability of transgenic lines and fluorescent protein combinations that can be distinguished. Here, we have transcriptionally profiled single hematopoietic cells from zebrafish to define erythroid, myeloid, B, and T cell lineages. We also used our approach to identify hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and a novel NK-lysin 4(+) cell type, representing a putative cytotoxic T/NK cell. Our platform also quantified hematopoietic defects in rag2(E450fs) mutant fish and showed that these fish have reduced T cells with a subsequent expansion of NK-lysin 4(+) cells and myeloid cells. These data suggest compensatory regulation of the innate immune system in rag2(E450fs) mutant zebrafish. Finally, analysis of Myc-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed that cells are arrested at the CD4(+)/CD8(+) cortical thymocyte stage and that a subset of leukemia cells inappropriately reexpress stem cell genes, including bmi1 and cmyb In total, our experiments provide new tools and biological insights into single-cell heterogeneity found in zebrafish blood and leukemia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Differentiation of metazoan cells requires execution of different gene expression programs but recent single-cell transcriptome profiling has revealed considerable variation within cells of seeming identical phenotype. This brings into question the relationship between transcriptome states and cell phenotypes. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics presents unique analysis challenges that need to be addressed to answer this question.

RESULTS:We present high quality deep read-depth single-cell RNA sequencing for 91 cells from five mouse tissues and 18 cells from two rat tissues, along with 30 control samples of bulk RNA diluted to single-cell levels. We find that transcriptomes differ globally across tissues with regard to the number of genes expressed, the average expression patterns, and within-cell-type variation patterns. We develop methods to filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate biological variation. All cell types include genes with high variability in expression, in a tissue-specific manner. We also find evidence that single-cell variability of neuronal genes in mice is correlated with that in rats consistent with the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved.

CONCLUSIONS:Single-cell RNA-sequencing data provide a unique view of transcriptome function; however, careful analysis is required in order to use single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements for this purpose. Technical variation must be considered in single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of expression variation. For a subset of genes, biological variability within each cell type appears to be regulated in order to perform dynamic functions, rather than solely molecular noise.},

abstract = {DNA evolution models made invaluable contributions to comparative genomics, although it seemed formidable to include non-genomic features into these models. In order to build an evolutionary model of transcription networks (TNs), we had to forfeit the substitution model used in DNA evolution and to start from modeling the evolution of the regulatory relationships. We present a quantitative evolutionary model of TNs, subjecting the phylogenetic distance and the evolutionary changes of cis-regulatory sequence, gene expression and network structure to one probabilistic framework. Using the genome sequences and gene expression data from multiple species, this model can predict regulatory relationships between a transcription factor (TF) and its target genes in all species, and thus identify TN re-wiring events. Applying this model to analyze the pre-implantation development of three mammalian species, we identified the conserved and re-wired components of the TNs downstream to a set of TFs including Oct4, Gata3/4/6, cMyc and nMyc. Evolutionary events on the DNA sequence that led to turnover of TF binding sites were identified, including a birth of an Oct4 binding site by a 2nt deletion. In contrast to recent reports of large interspecies differences of TF binding sites and gene expression patterns, the interspecies difference in TF-target relationship is much smaller. The data showed increasing conservation levels from genomic sequences to TF-DNA interaction, gene expression, TN, and finally to morphology, suggesting that evolutionary changes are larger at molecular levels and smaller at functional levels. The data also showed that evolutionarily older TFs are more likely to have conserved target genes, whereas younger TFs tend to have larger re-wiring rates.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:This report presents data on the prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as reported by parents of school-aged children (ages 6-17 years) in 2011-2012. Prevalence changes from 2007 to 2011-2012 were evaluated using cohort analyses that examine the consistency in the 2007 and 2011-2012 estimates for children whose diagnoses could have been reported in both surveys (i.e., those born in 1994-2005 and diagnosed in or before 2007).

DATA SOURCES:Data were drawn from the 2007 and 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), which are independent nationally representative telephone surveys of households with children. The surveys were conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics with funding and direction from the Health Resources and Services Administration's Maternal and Child Health Bureau.

RESULTS:The prevalence of parent-reported ASD among children aged 6-17 was 2.00% in 2011-2012, a significant increase from 2007 (1.16%). The magnitude of the increase was greatest for boys and for adolescents aged 14-17. Cohort analyses revealed consistent estimates of both the prevalence of parent-reported ASD and autism severity ratings over time. Children who were first diagnosed in or after 2008 accounted for much of the observed prevalence increase among school-aged children (those aged 6-17). School-aged children diagnosed in or after 2008 were more likely to have milder ASD and less likely to have severe ASD than those diagnosed in or before 2007.

CONCLUSIONS:The results of the cohort analyses increase confidence that differential survey measurement error over time was not a major contributor to observed changes in the prevalence of parent-reported ASD. Rather, much of the prevalence increase from 2007 to 2011-2012 for school-aged children was the result of diagnoses of children with previously unrecognized ASD.},

abstract = {Next-generation RNA sequencing has been successfully used for identification of transcript assembly, evaluation of gene expression levels, and detection of post-transcriptional modifications. Despite these large-scale studies, additional comprehensive RNA-seq data from different subregions of the human brain are required to fully evaluate the evolutionary patterns experienced by the human brain transcriptome. Here, we provide a total of 6.5 billion RNA-seq reads from different subregions of the human brain. A significant correlation was observed between the levels of alternative splicing and RNA editing, which might be explained by a competition between the molecular machineries responsible for the splicing and editing of RNA. Young human protein-coding genes demonstrate biased expression to the neocortical and non-neocortical regions during evolution on the lineage leading to humans. We also found that a significantly greater number of young human protein-coding genes are expressed in the putamen, a tissue that was also observed to have the highest level of RNA-editing activity. The putamen, which previously received little attention, plays an important role in cognitive ability, and our data suggest a potential contribution of the putamen to human evolution.},

abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

abstract = {Oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) encodes for a Rho-GTPase-activating protein, important for dendritic morphogenesis and synaptic function. Mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with X-linked intellectual disability associated with cerebellar hypoplasia. ADAR enzymes are responsible for A-to-I RNA editing, an essential post-transcriptional RNA modification contributing to transcriptome and proteome diversification. Specifically, ADAR2 activity is essential for brain development and function. Herein, we show that the OPHN1 transcript undergoes post-transcriptional modifications such as A-to-I RNA editing and alternative splicing in human brain and other tissues. We found that OPHN1 editing is detectable already at the 18th week of gestation in human brain with a boost of editing at weeks 20 to 33, concomitantly with OPHN1 expression increase and the appearance of a novel OPHN1 splicing isoform. Our results demonstrate that multiple post-transcriptional events occur on OPHN1, a gene playing an important role in brain function and development.},

abstract = {Deep shotgun sequencing and analysis of genomes, transcriptomes, amplified single-cell genomes, and metagenomes has enabled investigation of a wide range of organisms and ecosystems. However, sampling variation in short-read data sets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present many new computational challenges in data interpretation. These challenges have led to the development of new classes of mapping tools and {\em de novo} assemblers. These algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in sequencing throughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass computational algorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing data sets, thereby decreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the majority of errors. Digital normalization substantially reduces the size of shotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time requirements for {\em de novo} sequence assembly, all without significantly impacting content of the generated contigs. We apply digital normalization to the assembly of microbial genomic data, amplified single-cell genomic data, and transcriptomic data. Our implementation is freely available for use and modification.},

abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},

For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and important field.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity of multiparameter data collection and analysis in flow cytometry and the development of relatively inexpensive arc-lamp-based flow cytometers, which increases the probability that laboratories or institutions may have more than one type of instrument, creates a need for shareable analysis programs and for the transport of flow cytometric data files within an installation or from one institution to another. To address this need, we propose a standard file format to be used for all flow cytometric data. The general principles of this proposal are: (1) The data file will contain a minimum of three segments, TEXT, DATA, and ANALYSIS; (2) The TEXT and ANALYSIS segments consist of KEYWORDS, which are the names of data fields, and their values; (3) All TEXT is encoded in ASCII; (4) KEYWORDS and their values may be of any length; (5) Certain KEYWORDS will be standard, i.e., having specified formats to be recognized by all programs. The structure of the DATA segment will be uniquely defined by the values of KEYWORDS in the TEXT area. It may be in any bit resolution, facilitating compatibility between machines with different word length and/or allowing bit compression of the data. The structured nature of the TEXT area should facilitate management of flow cytometric data using existing data base management systems. The proposed file format has been implemented on VAX, PDP-11, and HP9920 based flow cytometry data acquisition systems.},

abstract = {The human brain has enormously complex cellular diversity and connectivities fundamental to our neural functions, yet difficulties in interrogating individual neurons has impeded understanding of the underlying transcriptional landscape. We developed a scalable approach to sequence and quantify RNA molecules in isolated neuronal nuclei from a postmortem brain, generating 3227 sets of single-neuron data from six distinct regions of the cerebral cortex. Using an iterative clustering and classification approach, we identified 16 neuronal subtypes that were further annotated on the basis of known markers and cortical cytoarchitecture.These data demonstrate a robust and scalable method for identifying and categorizing single nuclear transcriptomes, revealing shared genes sufficient to distinguish previously unknown and orthologous neuronal subtypes as well as regional identity and transcriptomic heterogeneity within the human brain.},

abstract = {RNA polymerases are highly regulated molecular machines. We present a method (global run-on sequencing, GRO-seq) that maps the position, amount, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases genome-wide. In this method, nuclear run-on RNA molecules are subjected to large-scale parallel sequencing and mapped to the genome. We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on approximately 30% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger RNA 3' cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter. These results imply that the interplay between polymerases and regulators over broad promoter regions dictates the orientation and efficiency of productive transcription.},

abstract = {Transcript quantification is a long-standing problem in genomics and estimating the relative abundance of alternatively-spliced isoforms from the same transcript is an important special case. Both problems have recently been illuminated by high-throughput RNA sequencing experiments which are quickly generating large amounts of data. However, much of the signal present in this data is corrupted or obscured by biases resulting in non-uniform and non-proportional representation of sequences from different transcripts. Many existing analyses attempt to deal with these and other biases with various task-specific approaches, which makes direct comparison between them difficult. However, two popular tools for isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks, have adopted a general probabilistic framework to model and mitigate these biases in a more general fashion. These advances motivate the need to investigate the effects of RNA-seq biases on the accuracy of different approaches for isoform quantification. We conduct the investigation by building models of increasing sophistication to account for noise introduced by the biases and compare their accuracy to the established approaches. We focus on methods that estimate the expression of alternatively-spliced isoforms with the percent-spliced-in (PSI) metric for each exon skipping event. To improve their estimates, many methods use evidence from RNA-seq reads that align to exon bodies. However, the methods we propose focus on reads that span only exon-exon junctions. As a result, our approaches are simpler and less sensitive to exon definitions than existing methods, which enables us to distinguish their strengths and weaknesses more easily. We present several probabilistic models of of position-specific read counts with increasing complexity and compare them to each other and to the current state-of-the-art methods in isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks. On a validation set with RT-PCR measurements for 26 cassette events, some of our methods are more accurate and some are significantly more consistent than these two popular tools. This comparison demonstrates the challenges in estimating the percent inclusion of alternatively spliced junctions and illuminates the tradeoffs between different approaches.},

abstract = {Experimental tumors contain a significant fraction of microregions that are chronically or transiently hypoxic. Experimental evidence showing that hypoxia (and subsequent reoxygenation) may have a profound impact on malignant progression and on responsiveness to therapy is growing. The clinical relevance of tumor oxygenation in human solid malignancies is under investigation. We have developed and validated a clinically applicable method for measurement of tumor oxygenation in locally advanced cancer of the uterine cervix using a computerized polarographic electrode system. Applying this procedure in patients with cervical cancers </= 3 cm in diameter, who gave informed consent, we have been studying the clinical relevance of tumor oxygenation prospectively since 1989. As of June 1995, 103 patients with advanced cancers of the uterine cervix [Federation Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes (FIGO) stages Ib, bulky (n = 13), IIa and IIb (n = 51), IIIa and IIIb (n = 34), and IVa and IVb (n = 5)] had entered the study. Fifty % of the patients had carcinomas with median pO2 readings <10 mm Hg, referred to as hypoxic tumors. Tumor oxygenation was found to be independent of various patient demographics and also of pretreatment tumor characteristics, such as clinical tumor stage and size, histological type, and differentiation. However, histopathological examination of the surgical specimens following radical tumor resection in 47 patients showed that low-pO2 tumors exhibited larger tumor extensions and more frequent (occult) parametrial spread, as well as lymph-vascular space involvement, compared to well-oxygenated tumors of similar clinical stage and size. Forty-two patients completing primary radiation therapy and 47 patients who underwent radical surgery were analyzed for treatment outcome after a median observation period of 28 months (range, 3-76 months). Patients with hypoxic tumors had significantly worse disease-free and overall survival probabilities compared to patients with nonhypoxic tumors. Cox regression analysis identified tumor oxygenation and FIGO stage as the most important independent prognostic factors. The poorer outcome of the patients with hypoxic tumors was mainly due to locoregional failures with and without distant metastases, irrespective of whether surgery or radiation was applied as primary treatment. Tumor oxygenation as measured with a standardized polarographic method proved to be a powerful new pretherapeutic prognostic parameter providing important information on malignant progression in terms of extracervical tumor spread and radioresistance in advanced cervical cancers.},

abstract = {Analysis of splice variants from short read RNA-seq data remains a challenging problem. Here we present a novel method for the genome-guided prediction and quantification of splice events from RNA-seq data, which enables the analysis of unannotated and complex splice events. Splice junctions and exons are predicted from reads mapped to a reference genome and are assembled into a genome-wide splice graph. Splice events are identified recursively from the graph and are quantified locally based on reads extending across the start or end of each splice variant. We assess prediction accuracy based on simulated and real RNA-seq data, and illustrate how different read aligners (GSNAP, HISAT2, STAR, TopHat2) affect prediction results. We validate our approach for quantification based on simulated data, and compare local estimates of relative splice variant usage with those from other methods (MISO, Cufflinks) based on simulated and real RNA-seq data. In a proof-of-concept study of splice variants in 16 normal human tissues (Illumina Body Map 2.0) we identify 249 internal exons that belong to known genes but are not related to annotated exons. Using independent RNA samples from 14 matched normal human tissues, we validate 9/9 of these exons by RT-PCR and 216/249 by paired-end RNA-seq (2 x 250 bp). These results indicate that de novo prediction of splice variants remains beneficial even in well-studied systems. An implementation of our method is freely available as an R/Bioconductor package SGSeq.},

abstract = {RNA deep sequencing technologies are revealing unexpected levels of complexity in bacterial transcriptomes with the discovery of abundant noncoding RNAs, antisense RNAs, long 5' and 3' untranslated regions, and alternative operon structures. Here, by applying deep RNA sequencing to both the long and short RNA fractions (<50 nucleotides) obtained from the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we have detected a collection of short RNAs that is generated genome-wide through the digestion of overlapping sense/antisense transcripts by RNase III endoribonuclease. At least 75% of sense RNAs from annotated genes are subject to this mechanism of antisense processing. Removal of RNase III activity reduces the amount of short RNAs and is accompanied by the accumulation of discrete antisense transcripts. These results suggest the production of pervasive but hidden antisense transcription used to process sense transcripts by means of creating double-stranded substrates. This process of RNase III-mediated digestion of overlapping transcripts can be observed in several evolutionarily diverse Gram-positive bacteria and is capable of providing a unique genome-wide posttranscriptional mechanism to adjust mRNA levels.},

abstract = {In mammalian cells, genetic instructions are usually revised by RNA splicing before they are translated to proteins. Here we demonstrate that a trans-splicing group I ribozyme can be employed to intentionally modify the sequence of targeted transcripts in tissue culture cells. By analyzing the ribozyme reaction products, we demonstrate that targeted trans-splicing can proceed in murine fibroblasts with high fidelity, providing direct evidence that ribozymes function as anticipated in a therapeutically relevant setting. Trans-splicing is not very specific however, and the ribozyme reacted with and tagged a variety of cellular transcripts with its 3' exon sequence. RNA tagging provides a unique approach to study RNA catalysis in mammalian cells. Such analysis should facilitate the logical development of safe, therapeutic ribozymes that can repair mutant RNAs associated with a variety of inherited diseases.},

abstract = {The composition of the human microbiota is recognized as an important factor in human health and disease. Many of our cohabitating microbes belong to phylum-level divisions for which there are no cultivated representatives and are only represented by small subunit rRNA sequences. For one such taxon (SR1), which includes bacteria with elevated abundance in periodontitis, we provide a single-cell genome sequence from a healthy oral sample. SR1 bacteria use a unique genetic code. In-frame TGA (opal) codons are found in most genes (85%), often at loci normally encoding conserved glycine residues. UGA appears not to function as a stop codon and is in equilibrium with the canonical GGN glycine codons, displaying strain-specific variation across the human population. SR1 encodes a divergent tRNA(Gly)UCA with an opal-decoding anticodon. SR1 glycyl-tRNA synthetase acylates tRNA(Gly)UCA with glycine in vitro with similar activity compared with normal tRNA(Gly)UCC. Coexpression of SR1 glycyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNA(Gly)UCA in Escherichia coli yields significant $\beta$-galactosidase activity in vivo from a lacZ gene containing an in-frame TGA codon. Comparative genomic analysis with Human Microbiome Project data revealed that the human body harbors a striking diversity of SR1 bacteria. This is a surprising finding because SR1 is most closely related to bacteria that live in anoxic and thermal environments. Some of these bacteria share common genetic and metabolic features with SR1, including UGA to glycine reassignment and an archaeal-type ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RubisCO) involved in AMP recycling. UGA codon reassignment renders SR1 genes untranslatable by other bacteria, which impacts horizontal gene transfer within the human microbiota.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

Applying both sliding-window and clustering strategies, we use anomalously mapped read pairs provided by current short read aligners to localize genomic rearrangements and classify them according to their type, e.g. large insertions-deletions, inversions, duplications and balanced or unbalanced inter-chromosomal translocations. SVDetect outputs predicted structural variants in various file formats for appropriate graphical visualization.

abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing affects a majority of human genes and plays important roles in development and disease. Alternative splicing (AS) events conserved since the divergence of human and mouse are likely of primary biological importance, but relatively few of such events are known. Here we describe sequence features that distinguish exons subject to evolutionarily conserved AS, which we call alternative conserved exons (ACEs), from other orthologous human/mouse exons and integrate these features into an exon classification algorithm, acescan. Genome-wide analysis of annotated orthologous human-mouse exon pairs identified approximately 2,000 predicted ACEs. Alternative splicing was verified in both human and mouse tissues by using an RT-PCR-sequencing protocol for 21 of 30 (70%) predicted ACEs tested, supporting the validity of a majority of acescan predictions. By contrast, AS was observed in mouse tissues for only 2 of 15 (13%) tested exons that had EST or cDNA evidence of AS in human but were not predicted ACEs, and AS was never observed for 11 negative control exons in human or mouse tissues. Predicted ACEs were much more likely to preserve the reading frame and less likely to disrupt protein domains than other AS events and were enriched in genes expressed in the brain and in genes involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and development. Our results also imply that the vast majority of AS events represented in the human EST database are not conserved in mouse.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry is an essential tool for dissecting the functional complexity of hematopoiesis. We used single-cell "mass cytometry" to examine healthy human bone marrow, measuring 34 parameters simultaneously in single cells (binding of 31 antibodies, viability, DNA content, and relative cell size). The signaling behavior of cell subsets spanning a defined hematopoietic hierarchy was monitored with 18 simultaneous markers of functional signaling states perturbed by a set of ex vivo stimuli and inhibitors. The data set allowed for an algorithmically driven assembly of related cell types defined by surface antigen expression, providing a superimposable map of cell signaling responses in combination with drug inhibition. Visualized in this manner, the analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances of both precise signaling responses that were bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets and more continuous phosphorylation responses that crossed cell population boundaries in unexpected manners yet tracked closely with cellular phenotype. Collectively, such single-cell analyses provide system-wide views of immune signaling in healthy human hematopoiesis, against which drug action and disease can be compared for mechanistic studies and pharmacologic intervention.},

abstract = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3%-8% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37%-53%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18%-37%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47%-68%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

abstract = {In T lymphocytes, intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) rises within seconds of T-cell antigen-receptor stimulation and initiates the synthesis and secretion of interleukin 2, a cytokine essential for T-cell proliferation and the immune response. Using video-imaging techniques, we tracked [Ca2+]i signals in individual T cells and measured subsequent expression of a beta-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ) controlled by the NF-AT element of the interleukin 2 enhancer. [Ca2+]i spikes elicited by monoclonal antibody binding to the CD3 epsilon subunit of the T-cell receptor were positively correlated with gene expression, but varied widely between individual cells and were therefore difficult to relate quantitatively to lacZ expression. The [Ca2+]i dependence of NF-AT-regulated gene expression was determined by elevating [Ca2+]i with either thapsigargin or ionomycin and then "clamping" [Ca2+]i to various, stable levels by altering either extracellular [Ca2+] or extracellular [K+]. Raising [Ca2+]i from resting levels of 70 nM to between 200 nM and 1.6 microM increased the fraction of cells expressing lacZ, with Kd approximately 1 microM. Activation of protein kinase C enhanced the [Ca2+]i sensitivity of gene expression (Kd = 210 nM), whereas stimulation of protein kinase A inhibited [Ca2+]i-dependent gene expression. The experiments described here provide single-cell measurements linking a second messenger to gene expression in individual cells.},

abstract = {The tree structure is currently the accepted paradigm to represent evolutionary relationships between organisms, species or other taxa. However, horizontal, or reticulate, genomic exchanges are pervasive in nature and confound characterization of phylogenetic trees. Drawing from algebraic topology, we present a unique evolutionary framework that comprehensively captures both clonal and reticulate evolution. We show that whereas clonal evolution can be summarized as a tree, reticulate evolution exhibits nontrivial topology of dimension greater than zero. Our method effectively characterizes clonal evolution, reassortment, and recombination in RNA viruses. Beyond detecting reticulate evolution, we succinctly recapitulate the history of complex genetic exchanges involving more than two parental strains, such as the triple reassortment of H7N9 avian influenza and the formation of circulating HIV-1 recombinants. In addition, we identify recurrent, large-scale patterns of reticulate evolution, including frequent PB2-PB1-PA-NP cosegregation during avian influenza reassortment. Finally, we bound the rate of reticulate events (i.e., 20 reassortments per year in avian influenza). Our method provides an evolutionary perspective that not only captures reticulate events precluding phylogeny, but also indicates the evolutionary scales where phylogenetic inference could be accurate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Despite the short length of their reads, micro-read sequencing technologies have shown their usefulness for de novo sequencing. However, especially in eukaryotic genomes, complex repeat patterns are an obstacle to large assemblies.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We present a novel heuristic algorithm, Pebble, which uses paired-end read information to resolve repeats and scaffold contigs to produce large-scale assemblies. In simulations, we can achieve weighted median scaffold lengths (N50) of above 1 Mbp in Bacteria and above 100 kbp in more complex organisms. Using real datasets we obtained a 96 kbp N50 in Pseudomonas syringae and a unique 147 kbp scaffold of a ferret BAC clone. We also present an efficient algorithm called Rock Band for the resolution of repeats in the case of mixed length assemblies, where different sequencing platforms are combined to obtain a cost-effective assembly.

CONCLUSIONS:These algorithms extend the utility of short read only assemblies into large complex genomes. They have been implemented and made available within the open-source Velvet short-read de novo assembler.},

The molecular mechanisms involved in primary RNA synthesis and subsequent post-processing are not completely understood, but there is increasing evidence that they are more tightly coupled than previously expected. The analyses by a number of groups of recently published genome wide maps of chromatin structure have further uncovered a role for primary chromatin structure in RNA processing. Indeed, these analyses have revealed that nucleosomes show a characteristic occupancy pattern in exonic regions of metazoan genomes. The pattern is strongly indicative of an implication of nucleosome positioning in exon recognition during pre-mRNA splicing. Characteristic exonic patterns have also been observed for a number of histone modifications, suggesting the possibility that chromatin state plays a direct role in the regulation of splicing.},

There was significant heterogeneity in the frequency of T cells that expressed individual cytokine mRNAs within each clonal population, suggesting that transcriptional control of each of the cytokine genes was not coordinate within an individual cell. The majority of antigen-stimulated Th1 cells expressed mRNA for interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), but far fewer cells in the same population expressed interleukin 2 (IL-2). Similarly, the frequency of IL-4-expressing cells was greater than that of IL-5- or IL-10-expressing cells in the same Th2 population, but the difference in expression frequencies was more variable between clones. The expression frequencies of each of the cytokines was quite heterogeneous in the antigen-activated Th0 population. The principal effect of increased antigen on the activation of individual cytokine genes in each of the clonal populations was to increase recruitment of mRNA-positive cells, with little or no effect on the level of cytokine mRNA expression in individual positive cells. The effects of B7 costimulation were variable depending on the cytokine gene analyzed. B7 costimulation markedly increased the frequency and the level of IL-2 mRNA expression in individual positive cells in the Th1 and Th0 populations, with less effect on the recruitment and single cell expression level of IFN-gamma. IL-4 frequencies were modestly increased by B7 costimulation of the Th2 clones, but there was no detectable increase in single cell IL-4 expression level. The observed patterns of cytokine mRNA expression favor a model of T cell activation in which all-or-none, rather than graded, responses of cytokine genes are dominant.},

abstract = {We present here a method for broadly characterizing single cells at the molecular level beyond the more common morphological and transmitter/receptor classifications. The RNA from defined single cells is amplified by microinjecting primer, nucleotides, and enzyme into acutely dissociated cells from a defined region of rat brain. Further processing yields amplified antisense RNA. A second round of amplification results in greater than 10(6)-fold amplification of the original starting material, which is adequate for analysis--e.g., use as a probe, making of cDNA libraries, etc. We demonstrate this method by constructing expression profiles of single live cells from rat hippocampus. This profiling suggests that cells that appear to be morphologically similar may show marked differences in patterns of expression. In addition, we characterize several mRNAs from a single cell, some of which were previously undescribed, perhaps due to "rarity" when averaged over many cell types. Electrophysiological analysis coupled with molecular biology within the same cell will facilitate a better understanding of how changes at the molecular level are manifested in functional properties. This approach should be applicable to a wide variety of studies, including development, mutant models, aging, and neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Analysis of small numbers of chromosomes using interphase fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) probes has revealed that 50% of human preimplantation embryos contain abnormal cells. Detection of high levels of mosaicism with so few probes has led some researchers to extrapolate that a full analysis of all 23 pairs of chromosomes would reveal that all human embryos contain a proportion of abnormal cells. However, existing cytogenetic protocols cannot achieve such an analysis due to technical limitations. We have developed a novel technique based on whole genome amplification and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), which for the first time allows the copy number of every chromosome to be assessed in almost every cell of a cleavage-stage embryo. We have successfully analysed 64 cells (blastomeres) derived from 12 embryos and have detected unusual forms of aneuploidy, high levels of chromosomal mosaicism, non-mosaic aneuploidy and chromosome breakage. This is the first report of a comprehensive assessment of chromosome copy number in human embryos and indicates that, despite high levels of mosaicism, some embryos do have normal chromosome numbers in every cell. Such embryos may have a superior developmental potential, and their low frequency may explain correspondingly low success rates of natural and assisted conception in humans.},

abstract = {The establishment of the cardiovascular system represents an early, critical event essential for normal embryonic development. An important component of vascular ontogeny is the differentiation and development of the endothelial and endocardial cell populations. This involves, at least in part, the expression and function of specific cell surface receptors required to mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, CD31) may well serve such a function. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed by the entire vascular endothelium in the adult. It is capable of mediating adhesion by a heterophilic mechanism requiring glycosaminoglycans, as well as by a homophilic, glycosaminoglycan independent, mechanism. It has been shown to regulate the expression of other adhesion molecules on naive T cells. This report documents by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis the expression of PECAM-1 during early post implantation mouse embryo development. PECAM-1 was expressed by early endothelial precursors first within the yolk sac and subsequently within the embryo itself. Interestingly, embryonic PECAM-1 was expressed as multiple isoforms in which one or more clusters of polypeptides were missing from the cytoplasmic domain. The sequence and location of the deleted polypeptides corresponded to exons found in the human PECAM-1 gene. The alternatively spliced isoforms were capable of mediating cell-cell adhesion when transfected into L-cells. The isoforms differed, however, in their sensitivity to a panel of anti-PECAM-1 monoclonal antibodies. These data suggest that changes in the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 may affect its function during cardiovascular development, and are consistent with our earlier report that systematic truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of human PECAM-1 resulted in changes in its ligand specificity, divalent cation and glycosaminoglycan dependence, as well as its susceptibility to adhesion blocking monoclonal antibodies. This is the first report of naturally occurring alternatively spliced forms of PECAM-1 having possible functional implications.},

Despite these large-scale studies, additional comprehensive RNA-seq data from different subregions of the human brain are required to fully evaluate the evolutionary patterns experienced by the human brain transcriptome. Here, we provide a total of 6.5 billion RNA-seq reads from different subregions of the human brain. A significant correlation was observed between the levels of alternative splicing and RNA editing, which might be explained by a competition between the molecular machineries responsible for the splicing and editing of RNA. Young human protein-coding genes demonstrate biased expression to the neocortical and non-neocortical regions during evolution on the lineage leading to humans. We also found that a significantly greater number of young human protein-coding genes are expressed in the putamen, a tissue that was also observed to have the highest level of RNA-editing activity. The putamen, which previously received little attention, plays an important role in cognitive ability, and our data suggest a potential contribution of the putamen to human evolution.},

We measured allelic mRNA expression in postmortem human striatum and prefrontal cortex and then performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scans of the DRD2 locus. A previously uncharacterized promoter SNP (rs12364283) located in a conserved suppressor region was associated with enhanced DRD2 expression, whereas previously studied DRD2 variants failed to affect expression. Moreover, two frequent intronic SNPs (rs2283265 and rs1076560) decreased expression of DRD2 short splice variant (expressed mainly presynaptically) relative to DRD2 long (postsynaptic), a finding reproduced in vitro by using minigene constructs. Being in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other, both intronic SNPs (but not rs12364283) were also associated with greater activity of striatum and prefrontal cortex measured with fMRI during working memory and with reduced performance in working memory and attentional control tasks in healthy humans. Our results identify regulatory DRD2 polymorphisms that modify mRNA expression and splicing and working memory pathways.},

abstract = {A set of 43 337 splice junction pairs was extracted from mammalian GenBank annotated genes. Expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences support 22 489 of them. Of these, 98.71% contain canonical dinucleotides GT and AG for donor and acceptor sites, respectively; 0.56% hold non-canonical GC-AG splice site pairs; and the remaining 0.73% occurs in a lot of small groups (with a maximum size of 0.05%). Studying these groups we observe that many of them contain splicing dinucleotides shifted from the annotated splice junction by one position. After close examination of such cases we present a new classification consisting of only eight observed types of splice site pairs (out of 256 a priori possible combinations). EST alignments allow us to verify the exonic part of the splice sites, but many non-canonical cases may be due to intron sequencing errors. This idea is given substantial support when we compare the sequences of human genes having non-canonical splice sites deposited in GenBank by high throughput genome sequencing projects (HTG). A high proportion (156 out of 171) of the human non-canonical and EST-supported splice site sequences had a clear match in the human HTG. They can be classified after corrections as: 79 GC-AG pairs (of which one was an error that corrected to GC-AG), 61 errors that were corrected to GT-AG canonical pairs, six AT-AC pairs (of which two were errors that corrected to AT-AC), one case was produced from non-existent intron, seven cases were found in HTG that were deposited to GenBank and finally there were only two cases left of supported non-canonical splice sites. If we assume that approximately the same situation is true for the whole set of annotated mammalian non-canonical splice sites, then the 99.24% of splice site pairs should be GT-AG, 0.69% GC-AG, 0.05% AT-AC and finally only 0.02% could consist of other types of non-canonical splice sites. We analyze several characteristics of EST-verified splice sites and build weight matrices for the major groups, which can be incorporated into gene prediction programs. We also present a set of EST-verified canonical splice sites larger by two orders of magnitude than the current one (22 199 entries versus approximately 600) and finally, a set of 290 EST-supported non-canonical splice sites. Both sets should be significant for future investigations of the splicing mechanism.},

To understand the biological roles and regulation of alternative splicing across different tissues and stages of development, systematic methods are needed. Here, we demonstrate the use of microarrays to monitor splicing at every exon-exon junction in more than 10,000 multi-exon human genes in 52 tissues and cell lines. These genome-wide data provide experimental evidence and tissue distributions for thousands of known and novel alternative splicing events. Adding to previous studies, the results indicate that at least 74% of human multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced.},

We compared RNA sequences from human B cells of 27 individuals to the corresponding DNA sequences from the same individuals and uncovered more than 10,000 exonic sites where the RNA sequences do not match that of the DNA. All 12 possible categories of discordances were observed. These differences were nonrandom as many sites were found in multiple individuals and in different cell types, including primary skin cells and brain tissues. Using mass spectrometry, we detected peptides that are translated from the discordant RNA sequences and thus do not correspond exactly to the DNA sequences. These widespread RNA-DNA differences in the human transcriptome provide a yet unexplored aspect of genome variation.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression {\&} path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

abstract = {The complete nucleotide sequences of rat M1- and M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs were determined by sequencing the cDNAs and by analyses of S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension. The sequences have an identical molecular size of about 2220 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail and include 1593-nucleotide coding region. Their nucleotide sequences are identical except for 160-nucleotide sequences within the coding regions. The amino acid sequences of the M1- and M2-type subunits deduced from the cDNA sequences differ by only 45 residues within domain C, which constitutes the main region responsible for intersubunit contact. The sequence of this region of the M2-type shows higher homology than that of the M1-type with the corresponding sequence of the L-type. Since the M2- and L-types are allosteric enzymes, unlike to the M1-type, the residues common to the M2- and L-types, but not the M1-type may be important for mediating the allosteric properties. Genomic clones encoding both M1- and M2-type isozyme mRNAs were isolated. By partial sequence analysis of a clone lambda MPK37 four exons were identified, of which two adjacent exons coded the M1- and M2-specific sequences, respectively. The two remaining exons present downstream coded amino acids common to the two isozymes. Thus, we conclude that the M1- and M2-type isozymes of pyruvate kinase are produced from the same gene probably by alternative RNA splicing.},

abstract = {The generation of cells of the neural lineage within the brain is not restricted to early development. New neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes are produced in the adult brain throughout the entire murine life. However, despite the extensive research performed in the field of adult neurogenesis during the past years, fundamental questions regarding the cell biology of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) remain to be uncovered. For instance, it is crucial to elucidate whether a single aNSC is capable of differentiating into all three different macroglial cell types in vivo or these distinct progenies constitute entirely separate lineages. Similarly, the cell cycle length, the time and mode of division (symmetric vs. asymmetric) that these cells undergo within their lineage progression are interesting questions under current investigation. In this sense, live imaging constitutes a valuable ally in the search of reliable answers to the previous questions. In spite of the current limitations of technology new approaches are being developed and outstanding amount of knowledge is being piled up providing interesting insights in the behavior of aNSCs. Here, we will review the state of the art of live imaging as well as the alternative models that currently offer new answers to critical questions.},

abstract = {Many differentiating tissues contain progenitor cells that differ in their commitment states but cannot be readily distinguished or segregated. Molecular analysis is therefore restricted to mixed populations or cell lines which may also be heterogeneous, and the critical differences in gene expression that might determine divergent development are obscured. In this study, we combined global amplification of mRNA transcripts in single cells with identification of the developmental potential of processed cells on the basis of the fates of their sibling cells from clonal starts.
We analyzed clones of from four to eight hemopoietic precursor cells which had a variety of differentiative potentials; sibling cells generally each formed clones of identical composition in secondary culture. Globally amplified cDNA was prepared from individual precursors whose developmental potential was identified by tracking sibling fates. Further cDNA samples were prepared from terminally maturing, homogeneous hemopoietic cell populations. Together, the samples represented 16 positions in the hemopoietic developmental hierarchy. Expression patterns in the sample set were determined for 29 genes known to be involved in hemopoietic cell growth, differentiation or function. The cDNAs from a bipotent erythroid/megakaryocyte precursor and a bipotent neutrophil/macrophage precursor were subtractively hybridized, yielding numerous differentially expressed cDNA clones. Hybridization of such clones to the entire precursor sample set identified transcripts with consistent patterns of differential expression in the precursor hierarchy.
Tracking of sibling fates reliably identifies the differentiative potential of a single cell taken for PCR analysis, and demonstrates the existence of a variety of distinct and stable states of differentiative commitment. Global amplification of cDNA from single precursor cells, identified by sibling fates, yields a true representation of lineage- and stage-specific gene expression, as confirmed by hybridization to a broad panel of probes. The results provide the first expression mapping of these genes that distinguishes between progenitors in different commitment states, generate new insights and predictions relevant to mechanism, and introduce a powerful set of tools for unravelling the genetic basis of lineage divergence.},

This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described.

Large-scale transcriptomics should complement these results to identify core molecular pathways underlying autism. Here we report results from a large-scale RNA sequencing effort, utilizing region-matched autism and control brains to identify neuronal and microglial genes robustly dysregulated in autism cortical brain. Remarkably, we note that a gene expression module corresponding to M2-activation states in microglia is negatively correlated with a differentially expressed neuronal module, implicating dysregulated microglial responses in concert with altered neuronal activity-dependent genes in autism brains. These observations provide pathways and candidate genes that highlight the interplay between innate immunity and neuronal activity in the aetiology of autism.},

The chooser method uses an entropy-based approach to propose an additional perturbation experiment to discriminate among the set of hypothetical networks determined by the predictor. These methods may be used iteratively and interactively to successively refine the genetic network: at each iteration, the perturbation selected by the chooser is experimentally performed to generate a new gene expression profile, and the predictor is used to derive a refined set of hypothetical gene networks using the cumulative expression data. Performance of the predictor and chooser is evaluated on simulated networks with varying number of genes and number of interactions per gene.},

Multiple experiments generate a cloud of points in this gene expression space. We present a geometric approach to analyzing the covariational properties of such a cloud and use a dataset from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an illustration. In particular, we use singular value decomposition to identify significant linear sub-structures in the data and analyze the contributions of both individual genes and functional classes of genes to these major directions of variation. Analyzing the publicly available yeast expression data, we show that under all experimental conditions the variation in expression is limited to a small number of linear dimensions. Projections of individual gene axes onto the significant dimensions can order the contribution of individual genes to variation in expression within an experiment. We show that no particular groups of genes characterize particular experimental conditions. Instead, the particular structure of the coordinated expression of the entire genome characterizes a particular experiment.},

Insistent application of the principles of analytical thinking helps both insiders and outsiders assess the credibility of evidence.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Identifying genes with bimodal expression patterns from large-scale expression profiling data is an important analytical task. Model-based clustering is popular for this purpose. That technique commonly uses the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for model selection. In practice, however, BIC appears to be overly sensitive and may lead to the identification of bimodally expressed genes that are unreliable or not clinically useful. We propose using a novel criterion, the bimodality index, not only to identify but also to rank meaningful and reliable bimodal patterns. The bimodality index can be computed using either a mixture model-based algorithm or Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.

RESULTS:We carried out simulation studies and applied the method to real data from a cancer gene expression profiling study. Our findings suggest that BIC behaves like a lax cutoff based on the bimodality index, and that the bimodality index provides an objective measure to identify and rank meaningful and reliable bimodal patterns from large-scale gene expression datasets. R code to compute the bimodality index is included in the ClassDiscovery package of the Object-Oriented Microarray and Proteomic Analysis (OOMPA) suite available at the web site http;//bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/Software/OOMPA.},

The output is displayed graphically, conveying the clustering and the underlying expression data simultaneously in a form intuitive for biologists. We have found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that clustering gene expression data groups together efficiently genes of known similar function, and we find a similar tendency in human data. Thus patterns seen in genome-wide expression experiments can be interpreted as indications of the status of cellular processes. Also, coexpression of genes of known function with poorly characterized or novel genes may provide a simple means of gaining leads to the functions of many genes for which information is not available currently.},

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

abstract = {A-to-I RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA is a post-transcriptional modification that is crucial for normal life and development in vertebrates. RNA editing has been shown to be very abundant in the human transcriptome, specifically at the primate-specific Alu elements. The functional role of this wide-spread effect is still not clear; it is believed that editing of transcripts is a mechanism for their down-regulation via processes such as nuclear retention or RNA degradation. Here we combine 2 neural gene expression datasets with genome-level editing information to examine the relation between the expression of ADAR genes with the expression of their target genes. Specifically, we computed the spatial correlation across structures of post-mortem human brains between ADAR and a large set of targets that were found to be edited in their Alu repeats. Surprisingly, we found that a large fraction of the edited genes are positively correlated with ADAR, opposing the assumption that editing would reduce expression. When considering the correlations between ADAR and its targets over development, 2 gene subsets emerge, positively correlated and negatively correlated with ADAR expression. Specifically, in embryonic time points, ADAR is positively correlated with many genes related to RNA processing and regulation of gene expression. These findings imply that the suggested mechanism of regulation of expression by editing is probably not a global one; ADAR expression does not have a genome wide effect reducing the expression of editing targets. It is possible, however, that RNA editing by ADAR in non-coding regions of the gene might be a part of a more complex expression regulation mechanism.},

abstract = {Lysosomes are organelles central to degradation and recycling processes in animal cells. Whether lysosomal activity is coordinated to respond to cellular needs remains unclear. We found that most lysosomal genes exhibit coordinated transcriptional behavior and are regulated by the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Under aberrant lysosomal storage conditions, TFEB translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in the activation of its target genes. TFEB overexpression in cultured cells induced lysosomal biogenesis and increased the degradation of complex molecules, such as glycosaminoglycans and the pathogenic protein that causes Huntington's disease. Thus, a genetic program controls lysosomal biogenesis and function, providing a potential therapeutic target to enhance cellular clearing in lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Microarray platforms are used increasingly to make comparative inferences through genome-wide surveys of gene expression. Although recent studies focus on describing the evidence for natural selection using estimates of the within- and between-taxa mutational variances, these methods do not explicitly or flexibly account for predicted nonindependence due to phylogenetic associations between measurements. In the interest of parsing the effects of selection: we introduce a mixture model for the comparative analysis of variation in gene expression across multiple taxa. This class of models isolates the phylogenetic signal from the nonphylogenetic and the heritable signal from the nonheritable while measuring the proper amount of correction. As a result, the mixture model resolves outstanding differences between existing models, relates different ways to estimate the across taxa variance, and induces a likelihood ratio test for selection. We investigate by simulation and application the feasibility and utility of estimation of the required parameters and the power of the proposed test. We illustrate analysis under this mixture model with a gene duplication family data set.},

abstract = {Microvascular networks support metabolic activity and define microenvironmental conditions within tissues in health and pathology. Recapitulation of functional microvascular structures in vitro could provide a platform for the study of complex vascular phenomena, including angiogenesis and thrombosis. We have engineered living microvascular networks in three-dimensional tissue scaffolds and demonstrated their biofunctionality in vitro. We describe the lithographic technique used to form endothelialized microfluidic vessels within a native collagen matrix; we characterize the morphology, mass transfer processes, and long-term stability of the endothelium; we elucidate the angiogenic activities of the endothelia and differential interactions with perivascular cells seeded in the collagen bulk; and we demonstrate the nonthrombotic nature of the vascular endothelium and its transition to a prothrombotic state during an inflammatory response. The success of these microvascular networks in recapitulating these phenomena points to the broad potential of this platform for the study of cardiovascular biology and pathophysiology.},

abstract = {As the amount of biomedical information available in the literature continues to increase, databases that aggregate this information continue to grow in importance and scope. The population of databases can occur either through fully automated text mining approaches or through manual curation by human subject experts. We here report our experiences in populating the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sponsored Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB, http://iedb.org), which was created in 2003, and as of 2012 captures the epitope information from approximately 99% of all papers published to date that describe immune epitopes (with the exception of cancer and HIV data). This was achieved using a hybrid model based on automated document categorization and extensive human expert involvement. This task required automated scanning of over 22 million PubMed abstracts followed by classification and curation of over 13~000 references, including over 7000 infectious disease-related manuscripts, over 1000 allergy-related manuscripts, roughly 4000 related to autoimmunity, and 1000 transplant/alloantigen-related manuscripts. The IEDB curation involves an unprecedented level of detail, capturing for each paper the actual experiments performed for each different epitope structure. Key to enabling this process was the extensive use of ontologies to ensure rigorous and consistent data representation as well as interoperability with other bioinformatics resources, including the Protein Data Bank, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, and the NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Centers. A growing fraction of the IEDB data derives from direct submissions by research groups engaged in epitope discovery, and is being facilitated by the implementation of novel data submission tools. The present explosion of information contained in biological databases demands effective query and display capabilities to optimize the user experience. Accordingly, the development of original ways to query the database, on the basis of ontologically driven hierarchical trees, and display of epitope data in aggregate in a biologically intuitive yet rigorous fashion is now at the forefront of the IEDB efforts. We also highlight advances made in the realm of epitope analysis and predictive tools available in the IEDB.},

abstract = {About half of human genes use alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (ApA) to generate messenger RNA transcripts that differ in the length of their 3' untranslated regions (3'~UTRs) while producing the same protein. Here we show in human cell lines that alternative 3'~UTRs differentially regulate the localization of membrane proteins. The long 3'~UTR of CD47 enables efficient cell surface expression of CD47 protein, whereas the short 3'~UTR primarily localizes CD47 protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. CD47 protein localization occurs post-translationally and independently of RNA localization. In our model of 3'~UTR-dependent protein localization, the long 3'~UTR of CD47 acts as a scaffold to recruit a protein complex containing the RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAVL1) and SET to the site of translation. This facilitates interaction of SET with the newly translated cytoplasmic domains of CD47 and results in subsequent translocation of CD47 to the plasma membrane via activated RAC1 (ref. 5). We also show that CD47 protein has different functions depending on whether it was generated by the short or long 3'~UTR isoforms. Thus, ApA contributes to the functional diversity of the proteome without changing the amino acid sequence. 3'~UTR-dependent protein localization has the potential to be a widespread trafficking mechanism for membrane proteins because HuR binds to thousands of mRNAs, and we show that the long 3'~UTRs of CD44, ITGA1 and TNFRSF13C, which are bound by HuR, increase surface protein expression compared to their corresponding short 3'~UTRs. We propose that during translation the scaffold function of 3'~UTRs facilitates binding of proteins to nascent proteins to direct their transport or function-and this role of 3'~UTRs can be regulated by ApA.},

abstract = {While a number of approaches have been geared toward multiple sequence alignments, to date there have been very few approaches to multiple structure alignment and detection of a recurring substructural motif. Among these, none performs both multiple structure comparison and motif detection simultaneously. Further, none considers all structures at the same time, rather than initiating from pairwise molecular comparisons. We present such a multiple structural alignment algorithm. Given an ensemble of protein structures, the algorithm automatically finds the largest common substructure (core) of C(alpha) atoms that appears in all the molecules in the ensemble. The detection of the core and the structural alignment are done simultaneously. Additional structural alignments also are obtained and are ranked by the sizes of the substructural motifs, which are present in the entire ensemble. The method is based on the geometric hashing paradigm. As in our previous structural comparison algorithms, it compares the structures in an amino acid sequence order-independent way, and hence the resulting alignment is unaffected by insertions, deletions and protein chain directionality. As such, it can be applied to protein surfaces, protein-protein interfaces and protein cores to find the optimally, and suboptimally spatially recurring substructural motifs. There is no predefinition of the motif. We describe the algorithm, demonstrating its efficiency. In particular, we present a range of results for several protein ensembles, with different folds and belonging to the same, or to different, families. Since the algorithm treats molecules as collections of points in three-dimensional space, it can also be applied to other molecules, such as RNA, or drugs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.

RESULTS:We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.

AVAILABILITY:Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

In a survey encompassing five classes of early hematopoietic precursor, we found markedly heterogeneous expression of the transcription factor PU.1 in hematopoietic stem cells and divergent patterns of PU.1 expression within flk2- and flk2+ common myeloid progenitors. The survey also revealed significant differences in the level of the housekeeping transcript GAPDH across the surveyed populations, which demonstrates caveats of normalizing expression data to endogenous controls and underscores the need to put gene measurement on an absolute, copy-per-cell basis.},

There is currently a lack of tools that would automatically estimate the best k to use and/or quickly generate histograms of k-mer abundances that would allow the user to make an informed decision. We develop a fast and accurate sampling method that constructs approximate abundance histograms with a several orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional methods. We then present a fast heuristic that uses the generated abundance histograms for putative k values to estimate the best possible value of k. We test the effectiveness of our tool using diverse sequencing datasets and find that its choice of k leads to some of the best assemblies.

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

abstract = {RNA secondary structure is required for the proper regulation of the cellular transcriptome. This is because the functionality, processing, localization and stability of RNAs are all dependent on the folding of these molecules into intricate structures through specific base pairing interactions encoded in their primary nucleotide sequences. Thus, as the number of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data sets and the variety of protocols for this technology grow rapidly, it is becoming increasingly pertinent to develop tools that can analyze and visualize this sequence data in the context of RNA secondary structure. Here, we present Sequencing Annotation and Visualization of RNA structures (SAVoR), a web server, which seamlessly links RNA structure predictions with sequencing data and genomic annotations to produce highly informative and annotated models of RNA secondary structure. SAVoR accepts read alignment data from RNA-seq experiments and computes a series of per-base values such as read abundance and sequence variant frequency. These values can then be visualized on a customizable secondary structure model. SAVoR is freely available at http://tesla.pcbi.upenn.edu/savor.},

Three eIF4A proteins have been characterized in vertebrates: eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 are cytoplasmic, whereas eIF4A3 is nuclear-localized. Although highly similar, they have been shown to possess rather diverse roles in the mRNA lifecycle. Their specific and diverse functions are often regulated and dictated by interacting partner proteins. The key differences between eIF4A family members are discussed in the present review.},

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and ribonucleoproteins coordinate RNA processing and PTGR. The introduction of large-scale quantitative methods, such as next-generation sequencing and modern protein mass spectrometry, has renewed interest in the investigation of PTGR and the protein factors involved at a systems-biology level. Here, we present a census of 1,542 manually curated RBPs that we have analysed for their interactions with different classes of RNA, their evolutionary conservation, their abundance and their tissue-specific expression.

This problem can be conveniently divided into two subproblems. The first is, given a collection of known binding sites, develop a representation of those sites that can be used to search new sequences and reliably predict where additional binding sites occur. The second is, given a set of sequences known to contain binding sites for a common factor, but not knowing where the sites are, discover the location of the sites in each sequence and a representation for the specificity of the protein.},

abstract = {The BolA-like protein is present in all eukaryotes, and it is able to form complex with monothiol glutaredoxin of the same subcellular compartments, suggesting that the BolA-like protein has essential function in eukaryotes, and that the function is associated with its partner glutaredoxin. Some studies have indicated a role for BolA proteins in Fe-S cluster synthesis or in redox homeostasis. However, the physiological function of BolA proteins remains to be elucidated. Here, we report the characterization of an insertion mutant of BolA3 in Arabidopsis. Among the four AtBolA proteins found in Arabidopsis, the AtBolA3 was the only BolA located in the cytosol of plant cells. It was highly expressed in roots. AtBolA3 was able to interact with the cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxin, AtGRXS17. The bola3 mutant did not show any notable phenotype under normal growth condition, but rather grew better than wild type under some stresses. The bola3 mutant was more tolerant to excess iron and the MV-induced oxidative stress than wild type. It displayed no necrosis in leaves, developed longer roots, accumulated more iron and higher Fe-S protein activities in roots. In addition, the mutant possessed a more potent antioxidant defense to scavenge ROS species. Taken together, our data indicated that the cytosolic AtBolA3 has a suppressive role in the tolerance to excess iron and the MV-induced oxidative stress in plants. AtBolA3 seems to be a repressor under some stress conditions.},

abstract = {DNA-binding transcriptional regulators interpret the genome's regulatory code by binding to specific sequences to induce or repress gene expression. Comparative genomics has recently been used to identify potential cis-regulatory sequences within the yeast genome on the basis of phylogenetic conservation, but this information alone does not reveal if or when transcriptional regulators occupy these binding sites. We have constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code by identifying the sequence elements that are bound by regulators under various conditions and that are conserved among Saccharomyces species. The organization of regulatory elements in promoters and the environment-dependent use of these elements by regulators are discussed. We find that environment-specific use of regulatory elements predicts mechanistic models for the function of a large population of yeast's transcriptional regulators.},

abstract = {Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is one of the major determinants in lipid transport, playing a critical role in atherosclerosis and other diseases. Binding to lipid and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) induces apoE to adopt active conformations for binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family. ApoE also interacts with beta amyloid peptide, manifests critical isoform-specific effects on Alzheimer's disease. Despite the importance of apoE in these major human diseases, the fundamental questions of how apoE adjusts its structure upon binding to regulate its diverse functions remain unsolved. We report the NMR structure of apoE3, displaying a unique topology of three structural domains. The C-terminal domain presents a large exposed hydrophobic surface that likely initiates interactions with lipids, HSPG, and beta amyloid peptides. The unique topology precisely regulates apoE tertiary structure to permit only one possible conformational adaptation upon binding and provides a double security in preventing lipid-free and partially-lipidated apoE from premature binding to apoE receptors during receptor biogenesis. This topology further ensures the optimal receptor-binding activity by the fully lipidated apoE during lipoprotein transport in circulation and in the brain. These findings provide a structural framework for understanding the structural basis of the diverse functions of this important protein in human diseases.},

abstract = {A regulated splicing event in protein 4.1R pre-mRNA-the inclusion of exon 16-encoding peptides for spectrin-actin binding-occurs in late erythroid differentiation. We defined the functional significance of an intronic splicing enhancer, UGCAUG, and its cognate splicing factor, mFox2A, on exon 16 splicing during differentiation. UGCAUG displays cell-type-specific splicing regulation in a test neutral reporter and has a dose-dependent enhancing effect. Erythroid cells express 2 UGCAUG-binding mFox-2 isoforms, an erythroid differentiation-inducible mFox-2A and a commonly expressed mFox-2F. When overexpressed, both enhanced internal exon splicing in an UGCAUG-dependent manner, with mFox-2A exerting a much stronger effect than mFox-2F. A significant reciprocal increase in mFox-2A and decrease in mFox-2F occurred during erythroid differentiation and correlated with exon 16 inclusion. Furthermore, isoform-specific expression reduction reversed mFox-2A-enhancing activity, but not that of mFox-2F on exon 16 inclusion. Our results suggest that an erythroid differentiation-inducible mFox-2A isoform is a critical regulator of the differentiation-specific exon 16 splicing switch, and that its up-regulation in late erythroid differentiation is vital for exon 16 splicing.},
