  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Alternative mRNA isoform usage is an important
                 source of protein diversity in mammalian cells. This
                 phenomenon has been extensively studied in bulk tissues,
                 however, it remains unclear how this diversity is reflected in
                 single cells. RESULTS: Here we use long-read sequencing
                 technology combined with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)
                 to reveal patterns of alternative full-length isoform
                 expression in single cells from the mouse brain. We found a
                 surprising amount of isoform diversity, even after applying a
                 conservative definition of what constitutes an isoform. Genes
                 tend to have one or a few isoforms highly expressed and a
                 larger number of isoforms expressed at a low level. However,
                 for many genes, nearly every sequenced mRNA molecule was
                 unique, and many events affected coding regions suggesting
                 previously unknown protein diversity in single cells. Exon
                 junctions in coding regions were less prone to splicing errors
                 than those in non-coding regions, indicating purifying
                 selection on splice donor and acceptor efficiency.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that mRNA isoform diversity
                 is an important source of biological variability also in
                 single cells.",

                 expression variation may be a byproduct of, for example,
                 dynamic or homeostatic processes, here we consider whether
                 single-cell molecular variation per se might be crucial for
                 population-level function. Under this hypothesis, molecular
                 variation indicates a diversity of hidden functional
                 capacities within an ensemble of identical cells, and this
                 functional diversity facilitates collective behavior that
                 would be inaccessible to a homogenous population. In reviewing
                 this topic, we explore possible functions that might be
                 carried by a heterogeneous ensemble of cells; however, this
                 question has proven difficult to test, both because methods to
                 manipulate molecular variation are limited and because it is
                 complicated to define, and measure, population-level function.
                 We consider several possible methods to further pursue the
                 hypothesis that variation is function through the use of
                 comparative analysis and novel experimental techniques.",

                 identifiable cells, whose number, together with their size and
                 type, ultimately defines the structure and functions of an
                 organism. While the total cell number of lower organisms is
                 often known, it has not yet been defined in higher organisms.
                 In particular, the reported total cell number of a human being
                 ranges between 10(12) and 10(16) and it is widely mentioned
                 without a proper reference. AIM: To study and discuss the
                 theoretical issue of the total number of cells that compose
                 the standard human adult organism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A
                 systematic calculation of the total cell number of the whole
                 human body and of the single organs was carried out using
                 bibliographical and/or mathematical approaches. RESULTS: A
                 current estimation of human total cell number calculated for a
                 variety of organs and cell types is presented. These partial
                 data correspond to a total number of 3.72 $\times$ 10(13).
                 CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the total cell number of the human body
                 as well as of individual organs is important from a cultural,
                 biological, medical and comparative modelling point of view.

                 becoming widespread in the systems biology community, as a
                 mean to understand biological processes at the cellular level.
                 However, as temporal information is lost with such data,
                 mathematical models have been limited to capture only static
                 features of the underlying cellular mechanisms. RESULTS: Here,
                 we present a modular framework which allows to recover the
                 temporal behaviour from single-cell snapshot data and reverse
                 engineer the dynamics of gene expression. The framework
                 combines a dimensionality reduction method with a cell
                 time-ordering algorithm to generate pseudo time-series
                 observations. These are in turn used to learn transcriptional
                 ODE models and do model selection on structural network

                 and can be predicted with multivariate models of the
                 phenotypic state and population context of single cells.
                 Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures
                 across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system
                 that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance
                 between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and
                 experimental validation show that nuclear retention and
                 transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm
                 is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional
                 fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates
                 that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional
                 noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering
                 with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the
                 cytoplasm.",

                 second layer of information is embedded in all RNA transcripts
                 in the form of RNA structure. RNA structure influences
                 practically every step in the gene expression program.
                 However, the nature of most RNA structures or effects of
                 sequence variation on structure are not known. Here we report
                 the initial landscape and variation of RNA secondary
                 structures (RSSs) in a human family trio (mother, father and
                 their child). This provides a comprehensive RSS map of human
                 coding and non-coding RNAs. We identify unique RSS signatures
                 that demarcate open reading frames and splicing junctions, and
                 define authentic microRNA-binding sites. Comparison of native
                 deproteinized RNA isolated from cells versus refolded purified
                 RNA suggests that the majority of the RSS information is
                 encoded within RNA sequence. Over 1,900 transcribed single
                 nucleotide variants (approximately 15\% of all transcribed
                 single nucleotide variants) alter local RNA structure. We
                 discover simple sequence and spacing rules that determine the
                 ability of point mutations to impact RSSs. Selective depletion
                 of 'riboSNitches' versus structurally synonymous variants at
                 precise locations suggests selection for specific RNA shapes
                 at thousands of sites, including 3' untranslated regions,
                 binding sites of microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins
                 genome-wide. These results highlight the potentially broad

                 initiation, elongation, cleavage, and transcript release.
                 Splicing of RNA can occur during (co-transcriptional) or after
                 (post-transcriptional) RNA synthesis. Thus, RNA synthesis and
                 processing occurs through the concerted activity of dozens of
                 enzymes, each of which is potentially susceptible to
                 perturbation by small molecules. However, there are few, if
                 any, high-throughput screening strategies for identifying
                 drugs which perturb a specific step in RNA synthesis and
                 processing. Here we have developed a high-throughput
                 fluorescence microscopy approach in single cells to screen for
                 inhibitors of specific enzymatic steps in RNA synthesis and

                 effect complex structural and regulatory outcomes. To reveal
                 the composition and dynamics of specific noncoding RNA-protein
                 complexes (RNPs) in vivo, we developed comprehensive
                 identification of RNA binding proteins by mass spectrometry
                 (ChIRP-MS). ChIRP-MS analysis of four ncRNAs captures key
                 protein interactors, including a U1-specific link to the 3'
                 RNA processing machinery. Xist, an essential lncRNA for X
                 chromosome inactivation (XCI), interacts with 81 proteins from
                 chromatin modification, nuclear matrix, and RNA remodeling
                 pathways. The Xist RNA-protein particle assembles in two steps
                 coupled with the transition from pluripotency to
                 differentiation. Specific interactors include HnrnpK, which
                 participates in Xist-mediated gene silencing and histone
                 modifications but not Xist localization, and Drosophila Split
                 ends homolog Spen, which interacts via the A-repeat domain of
                 Xist and is required for gene silencing. Thus, Xist lncRNA

                 the readout of genetic information, a functional landscape
                 that we are only beginning to understand. The cellular
                 mechanisms for the spatiotemporal organization of the plethora
                 of RNAs involved in gene expression are particularly poorly
                 understood. Intracellular single-molecule fluorescence
                 microscopy provides a powerful emerging tool for probing the
                 pertinent mechanistic parameters that govern cellular RNA
                 functions, including those of protein coding messenger RNAs
                 (mRNAs). Progress has been hampered, however, by the scarcity

                 molecules without the need to drastically increase their
                 molecular weight through artificial appendages that may result

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Differentiation of metazoan cells requires
                 execution of different gene expression programs but recent
                 single-cell transcriptome profiling has revealed considerable
                 variation within cells of seeming identical phenotype. This
                 brings into question the relationship between transcriptome
                 states and cell phenotypes. Additionally, single-cell
                 transcriptomics presents unique analysis challenges that need
                 to be addressed to answer this question. RESULTS: We present
                 high quality deep read-depth single-cell RNA sequencing for 91
                 cells from five mouse tissues and 18 cells from two rat
                 tissues, along with 30 control samples of bulk RNA diluted to
                 single-cell levels. We find that transcriptomes differ
                 globally across tissues with regard to the number of genes
                 expressed, the average expression patterns, and
                 within-cell-type variation patterns. We develop methods to
                 filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate
                 biological variation. All cell types include genes with high
                 variability in expression, in a tissue-specific manner. We
                 also find evidence that single-cell variability of neuronal
                 genes in mice is correlated with that in rats consistent with
                 the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing data provide a unique
                 view of transcriptome function; however, careful analysis is
                 required in order to use single-cell RNA-sequencing
                 measurements for this purpose. Technical variation must be
                 considered in single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of expression
                 variation. For a subset of genes, biological variability
                 within each cell type appears to be regulated in order to
                 perform dynamic functions, rather than solely molecular noise.",

               many processes in biology, including embryonic development and
               stem cell homeostasis. While heterogeneity of gene expression
               levels has been extensively studied, less attention has been
               paid to mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3′ untranslated
               regions regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly
               controlled during development, but how 3′ isoform usage varies
               within genetically and developmentally homogeneous cell
               populations has not been explored. Here, we perform genome‐wide
               quantification of polyadenylation site usage in single mouse
               embryonic and neural stem cells using a novel single‐cell
               transcriptomic method, BATSeq. By applying BATBayes, a
               statistical framework for analyzing single‐cell isoform data, we
               find that while the developmental state of the cell globally
               determines isoform usage, single cells from the same state
               differ in the choice of isoforms. Notably this variation exceeds
               random selection with equal preference in all cells, a finding
               that was confirmed by RNA FISH data. Variability in 3′ isoform
               choice has potential implications on functional cell‐to‐cell
               heterogeneity as well as utility in resolving cell populations.

  abstract    = "Functional genomics efforts face tradeoffs between number of
                 perturbations examined and complexity of phenotypes measured.
                 We bridge this gap with Perturb-seq, which combines
                 droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq with a strategy for
                 barcoding CRISPR-mediated perturbations, allowing many
                 perturbations to be profiled in pooled format. We applied
                 Perturb-seq to dissect the mammalian unfolded protein response
                 (UPR) using single and combinatorial CRISPR perturbations. Two
                 genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens identified
                 genes whose repression perturbs ER homeostasis. Subjecting
                 ∼100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional
                 clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses decoupled the three
                 UPR branches, revealed bifurcated UPR branch activation among
                 cells subject to the same perturbation, and uncovered
                 differential activation of the branches across hits, including
                 an isolated feedback loop between the translocon and
                 IRE1$\alpha$. These studies provide insight into how the three
                 sensors of ER homeostasis monitor distinct types of stress and
                 highlight the ability of Perturb-seq to dissect complex
                 cellular responses.",

  abstract    = "Synthesis of mRNA in eukaryotes involves the coordinated
                 action of many enzymatic processes, including initiation,
                 elongation, splicing, and cleavage. Kinetic competition
                 between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA
                 fate, yet such coupling has never been observed in vivo on
                 single transcripts. In this study, we use dual-color
                 single-molecule RNA imaging in living human cells to construct
                 a complete kinetic profile of transcription and splicing of
                 the $\beta$-globin gene. We find that kinetic competition
                 results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing.
                 Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both
                 before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a
                 strict quality control checkpoint. The majority of pre-mRNAs
                 are spliced after release, while diffusing away from the site
                 of transcription. A single missense point mutation (S34F) in
                 the essential splicing factor U2AF1 which occurs in human
                 cancers perturbs this kinetic balance and defers splicing to

  abstract    = "Reconstructing the lineage relationships and dynamic event
                 histories of individual cells within their native spatial
                 context is a long-standing challenge in biology. Many
                 biological processes of interest occur in optically opaque or
                 physically inaccessible contexts, necessitating approaches
                 other than direct imaging. Here we describe a synthetic system
                 that enables cells to record lineage information and event
                 histories in the genome in a format that can be subsequently
                 read out of single cells in situ. This system, termed memory
                 by engineered mutagenesis with optical in situ readout
                 (MEMOIR), is based on a set of barcoded recording elements
                 termed scratchpads. The state of a given scratchpad can be
                 irreversibly altered by CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted
                 mutagenesis, and later read out in single cells through
                 multiplexed single-molecule RNA fluorescence hybridization
                 (smFISH). Using MEMOIR as a proof of principle, we engineered
                 mouse embryonic stem cells to contain multiple scratchpads and
                 other recording components. In these cells, scratchpads were
                 altered in a progressive and stochastic fashion as the cells
                 proliferated. Analysis of the final states of scratchpads in
                 single cells in situ enabled reconstruction of lineage
                 information from cell colonies. Combining analysis of
                 endogenous gene expression with lineage reconstruction in the
                 same cells further allowed inference of the dynamic rates at
                 which embryonic stem cells switch between two gene expression
                 states. Finally, using simulations, we show how parallel
                 MEMOIR systems operating in the same cell could enable
                 recording and readout of dynamic cellular event histories.
                 MEMOIR thus provides a versatile platform for information
                 recording and in situ, single-cell readout across diverse
                 biological systems.",

                 surprisingly little is known about the modified positions and
                 their functions. Recently, various high-throughput
                 modification sequencing methods have been developed to
                 identify diverse post-transcriptional modifications of RNA
                 molecules. In this study, we developed a novel resource,
                 RMBase (RNA Modification Base,
                 http://mirlab.sysu.edu.cn/rmbase/), to decode the genome-wide
                 landscape of RNA modifications identified from high-throughput
                 modification data generated by 18 independent studies. The
                 current release of RMBase includes ∼ 9500 pseudouridine
                 ($\Psi$) modifications generated from Pseudo-seq and CeU-seq
                 sequencing data, ∼ 1000 5-methylcytosines (m(5)C) predicted
                 from Aza-IP data, ∼ 124 200 N6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A)
                 modifications discovered from m(6)A-seq and ∼ 1210
                 2'-O-methylations (2'-O-Me) identified from RiboMeth-seq data
                 and public resources. Moreover, RMBase provides a
                 comprehensive listing of other experimentally supported types
                 of RNA modifications by integrating various resources. It
                 provides web interfaces to show thousands of relationships
                 between RNA modification sites and microRNA target sites. It
                 can also be used to illustrate the disease-related SNPs
                 residing in the modification sites/regions. RMBase provides a
                 genome browser and a web-based modTool to query, annotate and
                 visualize various RNA modifications. This database will help

                 cellular heterogeneity but suffer from low coverage, 3' bias
                 and technical noise. These unique properties of single cell
                 RNA-seq data make study of alternative splicing difficult, and
                 thus most single cell studies have restricted analysis of
                 transcriptome variation to the gene level. To address these
                 limitations, we developed SingleSplice, which uses a
                 statistical model to detect genes whose isoform usage shows
                 biological variation significantly exceeding technical noise
                 in a population of single cells. Importantly, SingleSplice is
                 tailored to the unique demands of single cell analysis,
                 detecting isoform usage differences without attempting to
                 infer expression levels for full-length transcripts. Using
                 data from spike-in transcripts, we found that our approach
                 detects variation in isoform usage among single cells with
                 high sensitivity and specificity. We also applied SingleSplice
                 to data from mouse embryonic stem cells and discovered a set
                 of genes that show significant biological variation in isoform
                 usage across the set of cells. A subset of these isoform
                 differences are linked to cell cycle stage, suggesting a novel

  abstract    = "Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression,
                 but the mechanisms by which they act are still largely
                 unknown. One of the best-studied lncRNAs is Xist, which is
                 required for transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome
                 during development in female mammals. Despite extensive
                 efforts to define the mechanism of Xist-mediated
                 transcriptional silencing, we still do not know any proteins
                 required for this role. The main challenge is that there are
                 currently no methods to comprehensively define the proteins
                 that directly interact with a lncRNA in the cell. Here we
                 develop a method to purify a lncRNA from cells and identify
                 proteins interacting with it directly using quantitative mass
                 spectrometry. We identify ten proteins that specifically
                 associate with Xist, three of these proteins--SHARP, SAF-A and
                 LBR--are required for Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing.
                 We show that SHARP, which interacts with the SMRT co-repressor
                 that activates HDAC3, is not only essential for silencing, but
                 is also required for the exclusion of RNA polymerase II (Pol
                 II) from the inactive X. Both SMRT and HDAC3 are also required
                 for silencing and Pol II exclusion. In addition to silencing
                 transcription, SHARP and HDAC3 are required for Xist-mediated
                 recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across
                 the X chromosome. Our results suggest that Xist silences
                 transcription by directly interacting with SHARP, recruiting
                 SMRT, activating HDAC3, and deacetylating histones to exclude
                 Pol II across the X chromosome.",

                 settings. Here, we present a strategy for expansion microscopy

                 For the first time, we have the ability to monitor global gene
                 regulation in thousands of individual cells in a single
                 experiment. Such experiments will allow us to discover new
                 cell types and states and trace their developmental origins.
                 They overcome fundamental limitations inherent in measurements
                 of bulk cell population that have frustrated efforts to
                 resolve cellular states. Single-cell genomics and proteomics
                 enable not only precise characterization of cell state, but
                 also provide a stunningly high-resolution view of transitions
                 between states. These measurements may finally make explicit
                 the metaphor that C.H. Waddington posed nearly 60 years ago to
                 explain cellular plasticity: Cells are residents of a vast
                 ``landscape'' of possible states, over which they travel
                 during development and in disease. Single-cell technology
                 helps not only locate cells on this landscape, but illuminates
                 the molecular mechanisms that shape the landscape itself.
                 However, single-cell genomics is a field in its infancy, with

                 realize its full potential.",

                 essential that inclusion levels of alternative exons be
                 tightly regulated. However, how the precision of inclusion
                 levels among individual cells is governed is poorly

                 flanking intronic regions. Moreover, the inclusion levels of
                 alternative exons, as well as the expression levels of the
                 transcripts harboring them, also contribute to this precision.
                 We further show that alternative exons whose inclusion levels
                 are considerably changed during stem cell differentiation are
                 also subject to this regulation. Our results imply that

                 structure of the RNAs to accelerate their functions.
                 Biochemical and structural investigations of RNA modification
                 have primarily focused on ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer
                 RNAs (tRNAs), the best-characterized ncRNAs, which play
                 central roles in the translation of the genetic code.
                 Especially in tRNA, modifications not only stabilize the
                 L-shaped tertiary structure but also alter its function by
                 improving and switching its molecular recognition.
                 Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that the
                 modification procedure itself contributes to the RNA
                 (re)folding, in which the modification enzymes function as RNA
                 chaperones. Recent genome and postgenome (proteomics and
                 transcriptomics) analyses have identified new genes encoding
                 enzymes responsible for ncRNA modifications. Further
                 structural analyses of RNA-modification enzyme complexes have
                 elucidated the structural basis by which the modification
                 enzymes specifically recognize the target RNAs and ingeniously
                 incorporate the chemical modifications into the precise

              discovery of new principles and mechanisms of translation and
              expanded our view of the underlying logic of protein synthesis.
              Here, we review the three main methodologies for translatome
              analysis, and we highlight some of the recent discoveries made
              using each technique. We first discuss polysomal profiling, a
              classical technique that involves the separation of mRNAs
              depending on the number of bound ribosomes using a sucrose
              gradient, and which has been combined with global analysis tools
              such as DNA microarrays or high-throughput RNA sequencing to
              identify the RNAs in polysomal fractions. We then introduce
              ribosomal profiling, a recently established technique that
              enables the mapping of ribosomes along mRNAs at near-nucleotide
              resolution on a global scale. We finally refer to ribosome
              affinity purification techniques that are based on the
              cell-type-specific expression of tagged ribosomal proteins,
              allowing the capture of translatomes from specialized cells in
              organisms. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these
              three main techniques in the pursuit of defining the translatome,
              and we speculate about future developments.",

                 nuclear accumulation and their localization to paraspeckles.
                 This addresses the hypothesis that individual IMP protein
                 activities determine cargo nuclear access to influence cell
                 fate outcomes. We previously demonstrated that modulating
                 IMP$\alpha$2 levels alters paraspeckle protein 1 (PSPC1)
                 nuclear accumulation and affects its localization into a
                 subnuclear domain that affects RNA metabolism and cell
                 survival, the paraspeckle. An automated, high throughput,
                 image analysis pipeline with customisable outputs was created
                 using Imaris software coupled with Python and R scripts; this
                 allowed non-subjective identification of nuclear foci, nuclei
                 and cells. HeLa cells transfected to express exogenous
                 full-length and transport-deficient IMPs were examined using
                 SFPQ and PSPC1 as paraspeckle markers. Thousands of cells and
                 >100,000 nuclear foci were analysed in samples with modulated
                 IMP$\alpha$ functionality. This analysis scale enabled
                 discrimination of significant differences between samples
                 where paraspeckles inherently display broad biological
                 variability. The relative abundance of paraspeckle cargo
                 protein(s) and individual IMPs each influenced nuclear foci
                 numbers and size. This method provides a generalizable high
                 throughput analysis platform for investigating how regulated
                 nuclear protein transport controls cellular activities.",

                 We identify two conserved RNA-binding proteins, UNC-75/CELF

  abstract    = "RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct
                 effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled
                 by RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds
                 and thus has motivated extensive computational and
                 experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing
                 approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely
                 limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces
                 which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to
                 predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of
                 RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence
                 which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an
                 approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native
                 conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This
                 method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate
                 (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine
                 residues, followed by deep sequencing to monitor
                 modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in
                 excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and
                 with the high-resolution crystal structure of the
                 Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo
                 and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there
                 are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in
                 vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in
                 cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in
                 regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure
                 under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that
                 energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the
                 predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our
                 studies broadly enable the functional analysis of
                 physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to
                 the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure
                 formed is the most thermodynamically favourable,
                 thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA
                 structure in vivo.",

              exciting possibilities to address biological and medical
              questions, but a systematic comparison of recently developed
              protocols is still lacking. Results: We generated data from 447
              mouse embryonic stem cells using Drop‑seq, SCRB‑seq, Smart‑seq
              (on Fluidigm C1) and Smart‑seq2 and analyzed existing data from
              35 mouse embryonic stem cells prepared with CEL‑seq. We find that
              Smart‑seq2 is the most sensitive method as it detects the most
              genes per cell and across cells. However, it shows more
              amplification noise than CEL‑seq, Drop‑seq and SCRB‑seq as it
              cannot use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). We use
              simulations to model how the observed combinations of sensitivity
              and amplification noise affects detection of differentially
              expressed genes and find that SCRB‑seq reaches 80\% power with
              the fewest number of cells. When considering cost-efficiency at
              different sequencing depths at 80\% power, we find that Drop‑seq
              is preferable when quantifying transcriptomes of a large numbers
              of cells with low sequencing depth, SCRB‑seq is preferable when
              quantifying transcriptomes of fewer cells and Smart‑seq2 is
              preferable when annotating and/or quantifying transcriptomes of
              fewer cells as long one can use in-house produced transposase.
              Conclusions: Our analyses allows an informed choice among five
              prominent scRNA‑seq protocols and provides a solid framework for
              benchmarking future improvements in scRNA‑seq methodologies.",

                 analyze the alternative splicing of a target cassette exon
                 (skipping or inclusion), which results in an open-reading
                 frame shift. A fragment of a gene of interest is cloned
                 between red and green fluorescent protein (RFP and
                 GFP)-encoding sequences in such a way that translation of the
                 normally spliced full-length transcript results in expression
                 of both RFP and GFP. In contrast, alternative exon skipping
                 results in the synthesis of RFP only. Green and red
                 fluorescence intensities can be used to estimate the
                 proportions of normal and alternative transcripts in each
                 cell. The new method was successfully tested for human PIG3
                 (p53-inducible gene 3) cassette exon 4. Expected pattern of

                 individual cells with at least two distinct populations with
                 ∼45\% and >95\% alternative transcript. We believe that this

                 characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of
                 ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we
                 describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands
                 of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized
                 aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each
                 cell's RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq
                 analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells
                 simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin.
                 We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and
                 identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations,
                 creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known
                 retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes.
                 Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling
                 routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.

  abstract    = "Classic deamination mRNA changes, including cytidine to
                 uridine (C-to-U) and adenosine to inosine (A-to-I), are
                 important exceptions to the central dogma and lead to
                 significant alterations in gene transcripts and products.
                 Although there are a few reports of non-classic mRNA
                 alterations, as yet there is no molecular explanation for
                 these alternative changes. Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) mutations and
                 variants are implicated in several diseases, including Wilms
                 tumor and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We observed two
                 alternative G-to-A changes, namely c.1303G>A and c.1586G>A in
                 cDNA clones and found them to be recurrent in a series of 21
                 umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) samples studied.
                 Two less conserved U-to-C changes were also observed. These
                 alternative changes were found to be significantly higher in
                 non-progenitor as compared to progenitor CBMCs, while they
                 were found to be absent in a series of AML samples studied,
                 indicating they are targeted, cell type-specific mRNA editing
                 modifications. Since APOBEC/ADAR family members are implicated
                 in RNA/DNA editing, we screened them by RNA-interference
                 (RNAi) for WT1-mRNA changes and observed near complete
                 reversal of WT1 c.1303G>A alteration upon APOBEC3A (A3A)
                 knockdown. The role of A3A in mediating this change was
                 confirmed by A3A overexpression in Fujioka cells, which led to
                 a significant increase in WT1 c.1303G>A mRNA editing.
                 Non-progenitor CBMCs showed correspondingly higher levels of
                 A3A-mRNA and protein as compared to the progenitor ones. To
                 our knowledge, this is the first report of mRNA modifying
                 activity for an APOBEC3 protein and implicates A3A in a novel
                 G-to-A form of editing. These findings open the way to further
                 investigations into the mechanisms of other potential mRNA
                 changes, which will help to redefine the RNA editing paradigm
                 in both health and disease.",

                 genome and DNA methylome regulate each other, these omic

                 these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in these

                 should provide the number of DNA molecules in that cell and
                 their complete nucleotide sequences. We pose the formal
                 problem: can the genome sequence forming the genotype of a
                 given living cell be known with absolute certainty so that the
                 cell's behaviour (phenotype) can be correlated to that genetic
                 information? To answer this question, we propose a series of
                 thought experiments. RESULTS: We show that the genome sequence
                 of any actual living cell cannot physically be known with
                 absolute certainty, independently of the method used. There is
                 an associated uncertainty, in terms of base pairs, equal to or
                 greater than micros (where micro is the mutation rate of the
                 cell type and s is the cell's genome size). CONCLUSION: This

                 for the first time, and its analogy with the Heisenberg
                 uncertainty principle in physics is discussed. The genetic
                 information that makes living cells work is thus better

                 diversity in eukaryotes. However, how this affects protein
                 repertoires at a single-cell level remains an open question.
                 Here, we show that many 3'-terminal exons are persistently
                 co-expressed with their alternatives in mammalian neurons. In
                 an important example of this scenario, cell polarity gene
                 Cdc42, a combination of polypyrimidine tract-binding,
                 protein-dependent, and constitutive splicing mechanisms
                 ensures a halfway switch from the general (E7) to the
                 neuron-specific (E6) alternative 3'-terminal exon during
                 neuronal differentiation. Perturbing the nearly equimolar
                 E6/E7 ratio in neurons results in defects in both axonal and
                 dendritic compartments and suggests that Cdc42E7 is involved
                 in axonogenesis, whereas Cdc42E6 is required for normal
                 development of dendritic spines. Thus, co-expression of a
                 precise blend of functionally distinct splice isoforms rather

                 Streptococcus pyogenes has enabled rapid and accessible
                 alteration of specific genomic loci in many organisms. A
                 flexible means to target RNA would allow alteration and
                 imaging of endogenous RNA transcripts analogous to
                 CRISPR/Cas-based genomic tools, but most RNA targeting methods
                 rely on incorporation of exogenous tags. Here, we demonstrate
                 that nuclease-inactive S. pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 can bind RNA in
                 a nucleic-acid-programmed manner and allow endogenous RNA
                 tracking in living cells. We show that nuclear-localized
                 RNA-targeting Cas9 (RCas9) is exported to the cytoplasm only
                 in the presence of sgRNAs targeting mRNA and observe

                 dinucleotides and their immediate neighbors through the

                 these calls, we examined ~3,300 translocation events for 48
                 distinct DNA constructs. Each experiment analyzed a mixture of
                 cytosine-, 5-methylcytosine-, and

                 bases immediately 5' and 3' of the targeted CG dinucleotide,
                 and ranged from 1.7\% to 12.2\% for a single-pass read. We
                 estimate that Q40 values (0.01\% error rates) for methylation

  abstract    = "Studies of individual living cells have revealed that many
                 transcription factors activate in dynamic, and often
                 stochastic, pulses within the same cell. However, it has
                 remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic
                 interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here,
                 using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of
                 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile
                 transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate
                 their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse
                 timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed
                 activation in either a temporally overlapping or
                 non-overlapping manner during their transient response to
                 different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics
                 efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly,
                 under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1
                 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the
                 temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together,
                 these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene
                 regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is
                 common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results
                 suggest that it could also function broadly within the
                 signalling and regulatory systems of the cell.",
