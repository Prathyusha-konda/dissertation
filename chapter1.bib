  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Alternative mRNA isoform usage is an important
                 source of protein diversity in mammalian cells. This
                 phenomenon has been extensively studied in bulk tissues,
                 however, it remains unclear how this diversity is reflected in
                 single cells. RESULTS: Here we use long-read sequencing
                 technology combined with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)
                 to reveal patterns of alternative full-length isoform
                 expression in single cells from the mouse brain. We found a
                 surprising amount of isoform diversity, even after applying a
                 conservative definition of what constitutes an isoform. Genes
                 tend to have one or a few isoforms highly expressed and a
                 larger number of isoforms expressed at a low level. However,
                 for many genes, nearly every sequenced mRNA molecule was
                 unique, and many events affected coding regions suggesting
                 previously unknown protein diversity in single cells. Exon
                 junctions in coding regions were less prone to splicing errors
                 than those in non-coding regions, indicating purifying
                 selection on splice donor and acceptor efficiency.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that mRNA isoform diversity
                 is an important source of biological variability also in
                 single cells.",

                 activation of the general stress response mediated by the
                 alternative sigma factor, $\sigma$(B), in individual Bacillus
                 subtilis cells. We observed that energy stress activates
                 $\sigma$(B) in discrete stochastic pulses, with increasing
                 levels of stress leading to higher pulse frequencies. By
                 perturbing and rewiring the endogenous system, we found that
                 this behavior results from three key features of the
                 $\sigma$(B) circuit: an ultrasensitive phosphorylation switch;
                 stochasticity (``noise''), which activates that switch; and a
                 mixed (positive and negative) transcriptional feedback, which
                 can both amplify a pulse and switch it off. Together, these

                 variation indicates a diversity of hidden functional

                 functional diversity facilitates collective behavior that

                 this topic, we explore possible functions that might be
                 carried by a heterogeneous ensemble of cells; however, this
                 question has proven difficult to test, both because methods to
                 manipulate molecular variation are limited and because it is
                 complicated to define, and measure, population-level function.
                 We consider several possible methods to further pursue the

                 organismal development. To maintain robust splicing patterns,
                 many splicing factors autoregulate their expression through
                 alternative splicing-coupled nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD).
                 However, as negative autoregulation results in a self-limiting
                 window of splicing factor expression, it is unknown how
                 variations in steady-state protein levels can arise in
                 different physiological contexts. Here, we demonstrate that
                 Rbfox2 cross-regulates AS-NMD events within RNA-binding
                 proteins to alter their expression. Using individual
                 nucleotide-resolution cross-linking immunoprecipitation
                 coupled to high-throughput sequencing (iCLIP) and mRNA
                 sequencing, we identified >200 AS-NMD splicing events that are
                 bound by Rbfox2 in mouse embryonic stem cells. These
                 ``silent'' events are characterized by minimal apparent
                 splicing changes but appreciable changes in gene expression
                 upon Rbfox2 knockdown due to degradation of the NMD-inducing
                 isoform. Nearly 70 of these AS-NMD events fall within genes
                 encoding RNA-binding proteins, many of which are
                 autoregulated. As with the coding splicing events that we
                 found to be regulated by Rbfox2, silent splicing events are
                 evolutionarily conserved and frequently contain the Rbfox2
                 consensus UGCAUG. Our findings uncover an unexpectedly broad
                 and multilayer regulatory network controlled by Rbfox2 and

                 show that the identities and intensities of different stresses

                 frequency of nuclear translocation of the Saccharomyces

                 Through artificial control of the dynamics of Msn2
                 translocation, we reveal how distinct dynamical schemes
                 differentially affect reporter gene expression. Using a simple
                 model, we predict stress-induced reporter gene expression from
                 single-cell translocation dynamics. We then demonstrate that
                 the response of natural target genes to dynamical modulation

                 kinetics of promoter transitions and transcription factor
                 binding properties. Thus, multiple environmental signals can

                 the information encoded in the genome is differentially
                 interpreted to generate a diverse array of cell types. A
                 growing body of research on posttranscriptional gene
                 regulation is revealing that both global protein synthesis
                 rates and the translation of specific mRNAs are highly
                 specialized in different cell types. How this exquisite
                 translational regulation is achieved is the focus of this
                 review. Two levels of regulation are discussed: the
                 translation machinery and cis-acting elements within mRNAs.
                 Recent evidence shows that the ribosome itself directs how the
                 genome is translated in time and space and reveals surprising
                 functional specificity in individual components of the core
                 translation machinery. We are also just beginning to
                 appreciate the rich regulatory information embedded in the
                 untranslated regions of mRNAs, which direct the selective
                 translation of transcripts. These hidden RNA regulons may
                 interface with a myriad of RNA-binding proteins and
                 specialized translation machinery to provide an additional
                 layer of regulation to how transcripts are spatiotemporally
                 expressed. Understanding this largely unexplored world of
                 translational codes hardwired in the core translation

                 identifiable cells, whose number, together with their size and
                 type, ultimately defines the structure and functions of an
                 organism. While the total cell number of lower organisms is
                 often known, it has not yet been defined in higher organisms.
                 In particular, the reported total cell number of a human being
                 ranges between 10(12) and 10(16) and it is widely mentioned
                 without a proper reference. AIM: To study and discuss the
                 theoretical issue of the total number of cells that compose
                 the standard human adult organism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A
                 systematic calculation of the total cell number of the whole
                 human body and of the single organs was carried out using
                 bibliographical and/or mathematical approaches. RESULTS: A
                 current estimation of human total cell number calculated for a
                 variety of organs and cell types is presented. These partial
                 data correspond to a total number of 3.72 $\times$ 10(13).
                 CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the total cell number of the human body
                 as well as of individual organs is important from a cultural,
                 biological, medical and comparative modelling point of view.
                 The presented cell count could be a starting point for a
                 common effort to complete the total calculation.",

                 any given protein varies substantially from cell to cell, even
                 within isogenic populations. Recent experiments have measured

                 binding site identification by UV crosslinking and
                 immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of ribonucleoprotein complexes is
                 critical to understanding RBP function. However, current CLIP

                 developed an enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) protocol that decreases
                 requisite amplification by ∼1,000-fold, decreasing discarded
                 PCR duplicate reads by ∼60\% while maintaining

                 eCLIP improves specificity in the discovery of authentic

                 lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells
                 and propagate to the expression of downstream genes.
                 Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but
                 not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic
                 model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts
                 ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes
                 across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent
                 of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this

                 second layer of information is embedded in all RNA transcripts
                 in the form of RNA structure. RNA structure influences
                 practically every step in the gene expression program.
                 However, the nature of most RNA structures or effects of
                 sequence variation on structure are not known. Here we report
                 the initial landscape and variation of RNA secondary
                 structures (RSSs) in a human family trio (mother, father and
                 their child). This provides a comprehensive RSS map of human
                 coding and non-coding RNAs. We identify unique RSS signatures
                 that demarcate open reading frames and splicing junctions, and
                 define authentic microRNA-binding sites. Comparison of native
                 deproteinized RNA isolated from cells versus refolded purified
                 RNA suggests that the majority of the RSS information is
                 encoded within RNA sequence. Over 1,900 transcribed single
                 nucleotide variants (approximately 15\% of all transcribed
                 single nucleotide variants) alter local RNA structure. We
                 discover simple sequence and spacing rules that determine the
                 ability of point mutations to impact RSSs. Selective depletion
                 of 'riboSNitches' versus structurally synonymous variants at
                 precise locations suggests selection for specific RNA shapes
                 at thousands of sites, including 3' untranslated regions,
                 binding sites of microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins

                 initiation, elongation, cleavage, and transcript release.
                 Splicing of RNA can occur during (co-transcriptional) or after
                 (post-transcriptional) RNA synthesis. Thus, RNA synthesis and
                 processing occurs through the concerted activity of dozens of
                 enzymes, each of which is potentially susceptible to
                 perturbation by small molecules. However, there are few, if
                 any, high-throughput screening strategies for identifying
                 drugs which perturb a specific step in RNA synthesis and
                 processing. Here we have developed a high-throughput
                 fluorescence microscopy approach in single cells to screen for
                 inhibitors of specific enzymatic steps in RNA synthesis and
                 processing. By utilizing the high affinity interaction between
                 bacteriophage capsid proteins (MS2, PP7) and RNA stem loops,

                 $\beta$-globin reporter gene in human cells. This approach
                 allows one to measure the kinetics of transcription, splicing

                 genetically encoded assay in a stable cell line. We tested

                 spliceosomal U snRNAs share several structural similarities,
                 yet they are exported by distinct factors. We previously
                 showed that U1 snRNAs behaved like an mRNA in nuclear export
                 if various approximately 300-nucleotide fragments were
                 inserted in a central position. Here we show that this export
                 switch is dependent on the length of the insertion but
                 independent of its position, indicating unequivocally that
                 this switch is indeed the result of RNA length. We also show
                 that intronless mRNAs can be progressively converted to use
                 the U snRNA export pathway if the mRNAs are progressively
                 shortened by deletion. In addition, immunoprecipitation
                 experiments show that the protein composition of export RNPs

                 length is one of the key determinants of the choice of RNA

               for detecting and localizing particular RNA molecules in fixed

                 several decades. Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing
                 instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available,
                 and we used this for sequencing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
                 genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel
                 open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr
                 specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, because existing
                 packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths
                 (5-50 kbp) at such high error rates (between ∼5\% and 40\%
                 error). With this new method, we were able to perform a hybrid
                 error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary
                 MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly
                 contiguous and accurate: The contig N50 length is more than
                 ten times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678 kb
                 versus 59.9 kbp) and has >99.88\% consensus identity when
                 compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the
                 long nanopore reads presents a much more complete

                 one of the main sources giving rise to cell-to-cell variations

                 populations can enhance survival under adverse conditions and
                 stress, and has therefore played a fundamental role in
                 evolution. On the other hand, noise may have detrimental

                 the cascade of intermediate events resulting in the production

                 neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss
                 of upper and lower motor neurons, a cell type that is
                 intrinsically more vulnerable than other cell types to
                 exogenous stress. The interplay between genetic susceptibility
                 and environmental exposures to toxins has long been thought to
                 be relevant to ALS. One cellular mechanism to overcome stress
                 is the formation of small dense cytoplasmic domains called
                 stress granules (SG) which contain translationally arrested
                 mRNAs. TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP) is an ALS-causative gene
                 that we have previously implicated in the regulation of the
                 core stress granule proteins G3BP and TIA-1. TIA-1 and G3BP
                 localize to SG under nearly all stress conditions and are
                 considered essential to SG formation. Here, we report that
                 TDP-43 is required for proper SG dynamics, especially SG
                 assembly as marked by the secondary aggregation of TIA-1. We
                 also show that SG assembly, but not initiation, requires G3BP.
                 Furthermore, G3BP can rescue defective SG assembly in cells
                 depleted of endogenous TDP-43. We also demonstrate that
                 endogenous TDP-43 and FUS do not have overlapping functions in
                 this cellular process as SG initiation and assembly occur
                 normally in the absence of FUS. Lastly, we observe that SG
                 assembly is a contributing factor in the survival of
                 neuronal-like cells responding to acute oxidative stress.
                 These data raise the possibility that disruptions of normal
                 stress granule dynamics by loss of nuclear TDP-43 function may
                 contribute to neuronal vulnerability in ALS.",

                 biochemical studies indicate that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A)
                 is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA,
                 an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been
                 impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we
                 present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a
                 transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq,
                 based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel
                 sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized
                 by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000
                 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct
                 landmarks--around stop codons and within long internal
                 exons--and are highly conserved between human and mouse.
                 Although most sites are well preserved across normal and
                 cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset
                 of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is
                 identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase
                 significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing
                 patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as
                 TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore

                 impairment in ribosome function that is not observed in the

                 function is associated with a decreased rate and capacity for

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Differentiation of metazoan cells requires
                 execution of different gene expression programs but recent
                 single-cell transcriptome profiling has revealed considerable
                 variation within cells of seeming identical phenotype. This
                 brings into question the relationship between transcriptome
                 states and cell phenotypes. Additionally, single-cell
                 transcriptomics presents unique analysis challenges that need
                 to be addressed to answer this question. RESULTS: We present
                 high quality deep read-depth single-cell RNA sequencing for 91
                 cells from five mouse tissues and 18 cells from two rat
                 tissues, along with 30 control samples of bulk RNA diluted to
                 single-cell levels. We find that transcriptomes differ
                 globally across tissues with regard to the number of genes
                 expressed, the average expression patterns, and
                 within-cell-type variation patterns. We develop methods to
                 filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate
                 biological variation. All cell types include genes with high
                 variability in expression, in a tissue-specific manner. We
                 also find evidence that single-cell variability of neuronal
                 genes in mice is correlated with that in rats consistent with
                 the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing data provide a unique
                 view of transcriptome function; however, careful analysis is
                 required in order to use single-cell RNA-sequencing
                 measurements for this purpose. Technical variation must be
                 considered in single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of expression
                 variation. For a subset of genes, biological variability
                 within each cell type appears to be regulated in order to
                 perform dynamic functions, rather than solely molecular noise.",

               many processes in biology, including embryonic development and
               stem cell homeostasis. While heterogeneity of gene expression
               levels has been extensively studied, less attention has been
               paid to mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3′ untranslated
               regions regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly
               controlled during development, but how 3′ isoform usage varies
               within genetically and developmentally homogeneous cell
               populations has not been explored. Here, we perform genome‐wide
               quantification of polyadenylation site usage in single mouse
               embryonic and neural stem cells using a novel single‐cell
               transcriptomic method, BATSeq. By applying BATBayes, a
               statistical framework for analyzing single‐cell isoform data, we
               find that while the developmental state of the cell globally
               determines isoform usage, single cells from the same state
               differ in the choice of isoforms. Notably this variation exceeds
               random selection with equal preference in all cells, a finding
               that was confirmed by RNA FISH data. Variability in 3′ isoform
               choice has potential implications on functional cell‐to‐cell
               heterogeneity as well as utility in resolving cell populations.

                 relationships while accessing the transcriptome of selected
                 cells is a crucial feature for advancing many biological areas
                 - from developmental biology to neuroscience. However, because
                 of the high autofluorescence background of many tissue

                 fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) signals robustly

                 that combined with SPIM and PACT (passive CLARITY technique)

  abstract    = "Functional genomics efforts face tradeoffs between number of
                 perturbations examined and complexity of phenotypes measured.
                 We bridge this gap with Perturb-seq, which combines
                 droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq with a strategy for
                 barcoding CRISPR-mediated perturbations, allowing many
                 perturbations to be profiled in pooled format. We applied
                 Perturb-seq to dissect the mammalian unfolded protein response
                 (UPR) using single and combinatorial CRISPR perturbations. Two
                 genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens identified
                 genes whose repression perturbs ER homeostasis. Subjecting
                 ∼100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional
                 clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses decoupled the three
                 UPR branches, revealed bifurcated UPR branch activation among
                 cells subject to the same perturbation, and uncovered
                 differential activation of the branches across hits, including
                 an isolated feedback loop between the translocon and
                 IRE1$\alpha$. These studies provide insight into how the three
                 sensors of ER homeostasis monitor distinct types of stress and

                 that ribosome activity may be highly regulated. Heterogeneity

                 action of many enzymatic processes, including initiation,
                 elongation, splicing, and cleavage. Kinetic competition
                 between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA
                 fate, yet such coupling has never been observed in vivo on
                 single transcripts. In this study, we use dual-color
                 single-molecule RNA imaging in living human cells to construct
                 a complete kinetic profile of transcription and splicing of
                 the $\beta$-globin gene. We find that kinetic competition
                 results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing.
                 Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both
                 before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a

  abstract    = "Reconstructing the lineage relationships and dynamic event
                 histories of individual cells within their native spatial
                 context is a long-standing challenge in biology. Many
                 biological processes of interest occur in optically opaque or
                 physically inaccessible contexts, necessitating approaches
                 other than direct imaging. Here we describe a synthetic system
                 that enables cells to record lineage information and event
                 histories in the genome in a format that can be subsequently
                 read out of single cells in situ. This system, termed memory
                 by engineered mutagenesis with optical in situ readout
                 (MEMOIR), is based on a set of barcoded recording elements
                 termed scratchpads. The state of a given scratchpad can be
                 irreversibly altered by CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted
                 mutagenesis, and later read out in single cells through
                 multiplexed single-molecule RNA fluorescence hybridization
                 (smFISH). Using MEMOIR as a proof of principle, we engineered
                 mouse embryonic stem cells to contain multiple scratchpads and
                 other recording components. In these cells, scratchpads were
                 altered in a progressive and stochastic fashion as the cells
                 proliferated. Analysis of the final states of scratchpads in
                 single cells in situ enabled reconstruction of lineage
                 information from cell colonies. Combining analysis of
                 endogenous gene expression with lineage reconstruction in the
                 same cells further allowed inference of the dynamic rates at
                 which embryonic stem cells switch between two gene expression
                 states. Finally, using simulations, we show how parallel

                 modification data generated by 18 independent studies. The
                 current release of RMBase includes ∼ 9500 pseudouridine
                 ($\Psi$) modifications generated from Pseudo-seq and CeU-seq

              We have determined the lineages of 182 cells by tracing the
              divisions of individual cells in living embryos. An invariant
              pattern of cleavage divisions of the egg generates a set of stem
              cells. These stem cells are the founders of six stem cell
              lineages. Each lineage has its own clock--i.e., an autonomous
              rhythm of synchronous cell divisions. The rhythms are maintained

                 are responsible for protein synthesis in all living organisms.
                 Work published in the past year has shown that changes to the
                 ribosome core can affect the mechanism of translation
                 initiation that is favored in the cell, which potentially
                 leads to specific changes in the relative efficiencies with
                 which different proteins are made. Here, I examine recent data
                 from expression and proteomic studies that suggest that cells
                 make slightly different ribosomes under different growth
                 conditions, and discuss genetic evidence that such differences
                 are functional. In particular, I argue that eukaryotic cells
                 probably produce ribosomes that lack one or more core
                 ribosomal proteins (RPs) under some conditions, and that core
                 RPs contribute differentially to translation of distinct

                 cellular heterogeneity but suffer from low coverage, 3' bias
                 and technical noise. These unique properties of single cell
                 RNA-seq data make study of alternative splicing difficult, and
                 thus most single cell studies have restricted analysis of
                 transcriptome variation to the gene level. To address these
                 limitations, we developed SingleSplice, which uses a
                 statistical model to detect genes whose isoform usage shows
                 biological variation significantly exceeding technical noise
                 in a population of single cells. Importantly, SingleSplice is
                 tailored to the unique demands of single cell analysis,
                 detecting isoform usage differences without attempting to
                 infer expression levels for full-length transcripts. Using
                 data from spike-in transcripts, we found that our approach
                 detects variation in isoform usage among single cells with
                 high sensitivity and specificity. We also applied SingleSplice
                 to data from mouse embryonic stem cells and discovered a set

                 usage across the set of cells. A subset of these isoform

                 that nuclear Rbfox proteins are bound within a large assembly

                 Rbfox. Virtually all the intron-bound Rbfox is associated with

                 eukaryotic organisms with limited gene numbers. Split
                 eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences or introns
                 disrupting protein-coding exons, and intron removal occurs by
                 repeated assembly of a large and highly dynamic
                 ribonucleoprotein complex termed the spliceosome, which is
                 composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles,
                 U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5. Biochemical studies over the past 10
                 years have allowed the isolation as well as compositional,
                 functional, and structural analysis of splicing complexes at
                 distinct stages along the spliceosome cycle. The average human
                 gene contains eight exons and seven introns, producing an
                 average of three or more alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms.
                 Recent high-throughput sequencing studies indicate that 100\%
                 of human genes produce at least two alternative mRNA isoforms.
                 Mechanisms of alternative splicing include RNA-protein
                 interactions of splicing factors with regulatory sites termed
                 silencers or enhancers, RNA-RNA base-pairing interactions, or
                 chromatin-based effects that can change or determine splicing
                 patterns. Disease-causing mutations can often occur in splice
                 sites near intron borders or in exonic or intronic RNA
                 regulatory silencer or enhancer elements, as well as in genes
                 that encode splicing factors. Together, these studies provide
                 mechanistic insights into how spliceosome assembly, dynamics,
                 and catalysis occur; how alternative splicing is regulated and
                 evolves; and how splicing can be disrupted by cis- and
                 trans-acting mutations leading to disease states. These

                 unknown. One of the best-studied lncRNAs is Xist, which is
                 required for transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome
                 during development in female mammals. Despite extensive
                 efforts to define the mechanism of Xist-mediated
                 transcriptional silencing, we still do not know any proteins
                 required for this role. The main challenge is that there are
                 currently no methods to comprehensively define the proteins
                 that directly interact with a lncRNA in the cell. Here we
                 develop a method to purify a lncRNA from cells and identify
                 proteins interacting with it directly using quantitative mass
                 spectrometry. We identify ten proteins that specifically
                 associate with Xist, three of these proteins--SHARP, SAF-A and
                 LBR--are required for Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing.
                 We show that SHARP, which interacts with the SMRT co-repressor
                 that activates HDAC3, is not only essential for silencing, but
                 is also required for the exclusion of RNA polymerase II (Pol
                 II) from the inactive X. Both SMRT and HDAC3 are also required
                 for silencing and Pol II exclusion. In addition to silencing
                 transcription, SHARP and HDAC3 are required for Xist-mediated
                 recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across
                 the X chromosome. Our results suggest that Xist silences
                 transcription by directly interacting with SHARP, recruiting
                 SMRT, activating HDAC3, and deacetylating histones to exclude

                 specificity as well as single-molecule precision in both

                 For the first time, we have the ability to monitor global gene
                 regulation in thousands of individual cells in a single
                 experiment. Such experiments will allow us to discover new
                 cell types and states and trace their developmental origins.
                 They overcome fundamental limitations inherent in measurements
                 of bulk cell population that have frustrated efforts to
                 resolve cellular states. Single-cell genomics and proteomics
                 enable not only precise characterization of cell state, but
                 also provide a stunningly high-resolution view of transitions
                 between states. These measurements may finally make explicit
                 the metaphor that C.H. Waddington posed nearly 60 years ago to
                 explain cellular plasticity: Cells are residents of a vast
                 ``landscape'' of possible states, over which they travel
                 during development and in disease. Single-cell technology
                 helps not only locate cells on this landscape, but illuminates
                 the molecular mechanisms that shape the landscape itself.
                 However, single-cell genomics is a field in its infancy, with

                 founding members of a new class of RNA granules, known as mRNA
                 silencing foci, as they harbour transcripts circumstantially
                 excluded from the translationally active pool. PBs and SGs are
                 able to release mRNAs thus allowing their translation. PBs are
                 constitutive, but respond to stimuli that affect mRNA
                 translation and decay, whereas SGs are specifically induced
                 upon cellular stress, which triggers a global translational
                 silencing by several pathways, including phosphorylation of
                 the key translation initiation factor eIF2alpha, and tRNA
                 cleavage among others. PBs and SGs with different compositions
                 may coexist in a single cell. These macromolecular aggregates
                 are highly conserved through evolution, from unicellular
                 organisms to vertebrate neurons. Their dynamics is regulated
                 by several signaling pathways, and depends on microfilaments
                 and microtubules, and the cognate molecular motors myosin,
                 dynein, and kinesin. SGs share features with aggresomes and
                 related aggregates of unfolded proteins frequently present in
                 neurodegenerative diseases, and may play a role in the
                 pathology. Virus infections may induce or impair SG formation.
                 Besides being important for mRNA regulation upon stress, SGs
                 modulate the signaling balancing apoptosis and cell survival.
                 Finally, the formation of Nuclear Stress Bodies (nSBs), which
                 share components with SGs, and the assembly of additional
                 cytosolic aggregates containing RNA -the UV granules and the
                 Ire1 foci-, all of them induced by specific cell damage

  abstract    = "Alternative splicing is a key cellular mechanism for
                 generating distinct isoforms, whose relative abundances
                 regulate critical cellular processes. It is therefore
                 essential that inclusion levels of alternative exons be
                 tightly regulated. However, how the precision of inclusion
                 levels among individual cells is governed is poorly
                 understood. Using single-cell gene expression, we show that
                 the precision of inclusion levels of alternative exons is
                 determined by the degree of evolutionary conservation at their
                 flanking intronic regions. Moreover, the inclusion levels of
                 alternative exons, as well as the expression levels of the
                 transcripts harboring them, also contribute to this precision.
                 We further show that alternative exons whose inclusion levels
                 are considerably changed during stem cell differentiation are
                 also subject to this regulation. Our results imply that
                 alternative splicing is coordinately regulated to achieve
                 accuracy in relative isoform abundances and that such accuracy
                 may be important in determining cell fate.",

  abstract    = "Complex tissues, such as the brain, are composed of multiple
                 different cell types, each of which have distinct and
                 important roles, for example in neural function. Moreover, it
                 has recently been appreciated that the cells that make up
                 these sub-cell types themselves harbour significant
                 cell-to-cell heterogeneity, in particular at the level of gene
                 expression. The ability to study this heterogeneity has been
                 revolutionised by advances in experimental technology, such as
                 Wholemount in Situ Hybridizations (WiSH) and single-cell
                 RNA-sequencing. Consequently, it is now possible to study gene
                 expression levels in thousands of cells from the same tissue
                 type. After generating such data one of the key goals is to
                 cluster the cells into groups that correspond to both known
                 and putatively novel cell types. Whilst many clustering
                 algorithms exist, they are typically unable to incorporate
                 information about the spatial dependence between cells within
                 the tissue under study. When such information exists it
                 provides important insights that should be directly included
                 in the clustering scheme. To this end we have developed a
                 clustering method that uses a Hidden Markov Random Field
                 (HMRF) model to exploit both quantitative measures of
                 expression and spatial information. To accurately reflect the
                 underlying biology, we extend current HMRF approaches by
                 allowing the degree of spatial coherency to differ between
                 clusters. We demonstrate the utility of our method using
                 simulated data before applying it to cluster single cell gene
                 expression data generated by applying WiSH to study expression
                 patterns in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis
                 dumereilii. Our approach allows known cell types to be
                 identified as well as revealing new, previously unexplored
                 cell types within the brain of this important model system.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking and
                 immunoprecipitation (CLIP) identifies the sites on RNAs that
                 are in direct contact with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).
                 Several variants of CLIP exist, which require different
                 computational approaches for analysis. This variety of
                 approaches can create challenges for a novice user and can
                 hamper insights from multi-study comparisons. Here, we produce
                 data with multiple variants of CLIP and evaluate the data with
                 various computational methods to better understand their
                 suitability. RESULTS: We perform experiments for PTBP1 and
                 eIF4A3 using individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP (iCLIP),
                 employing either UV-C or photoactivatable 4-thiouridine (4SU)
                 combined with UV-A crosslinking and compare the results with
                 published data. As previously noted, the positions of
                 complementary DNA (cDNA)-starts depend on cDNA length in
                 several iCLIP experiments and we now find that this is caused
                 by constrained cDNA-ends, which can result from the sequence
                 and structure constraints of RNA fragmentation. These
                 constraints are overcome when fragmentation by RNase I is
                 efficient and when a broad cDNA size range is obtained. Our
                 study also shows that if RNase does not efficiently cut within
                 the binding sites, the original CLIP method is less capable of
                 identifying the longer binding sites of RBPs. In contrast, we
                 show that a broad size range of cDNAs in iCLIP allows the
                 cDNA-starts to efficiently delineate the complete RNA-binding
                 sites. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the advantage of iCLIP and
                 related methods that can amplify cDNAs that truncate at
                 crosslink sites and we show that computational analyses based
                 on cDNAs-starts are appropriate for such methods.",

                 Biochemical and structural investigations of RNA modification
                 have primarily focused on ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer
                 RNAs (tRNAs), the best-characterized ncRNAs, which play
                 central roles in the translation of the genetic code.
                 Especially in tRNA, modifications not only stabilize the
                 L-shaped tertiary structure but also alter its function by
                 improving and switching its molecular recognition.
                 Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that the
                 modification procedure itself contributes to the RNA
                 (re)folding, in which the modification enzymes function as RNA
                 chaperones. Recent genome and postgenome (proteomics and
                 transcriptomics) analyses have identified new genes encoding
                 enzymes responsible for ncRNA modifications. Further
                 structural analyses of RNA-modification enzyme complexes have
                 elucidated the structural basis by which the modification

  abstract = "During the past decade, there has been a rapidly increased
              appreciation of the role of translation as a key regulatory node
              in gene expression. Thereby, the development of methods to infer
              the translatome, which refers to the entirety of mRNAs associated
              with ribosomes for protein synthesis, has facilitated the
              discovery of new principles and mechanisms of translation and
              expanded our view of the underlying logic of protein synthesis.
              Here, we review the three main methodologies for translatome
              analysis, and we highlight some of the recent discoveries made
              using each technique. We first discuss polysomal profiling, a
              classical technique that involves the separation of mRNAs
              depending on the number of bound ribosomes using a sucrose
              gradient, and which has been combined with global analysis tools
              such as DNA microarrays or high-throughput RNA sequencing to
              identify the RNAs in polysomal fractions. We then introduce
              ribosomal profiling, a recently established technique that
              enables the mapping of ribosomes along mRNAs at near-nucleotide
              resolution on a global scale. We finally refer to ribosome
              affinity purification techniques that are based on the
              cell-type-specific expression of tagged ribosomal proteins,
              allowing the capture of translatomes from specialized cells in
              organisms. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these
              three main techniques in the pursuit of defining the translatome,

                 Often, the affinities between individual proteins are
                 relatively weak, and proteins within such clusters may
                 interact only indirectly with many of their other protein
                 neighbors. This makes proteomic characterization difficult

                 platform promises to decrease costs for reagents and
                 instrumentation. After a 2-year hiatus following the initial
                 announcement, the first devices have been released as part of
                 an early access program. We explore the performance of this
                 platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and
                 amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the
                 handheld MinION sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases
                 of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting
                 reads map to the reference, with less than average 10\%
                 identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion
                 errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template.
                 Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads
                 are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 $\pm$ 1932 bases per
                 mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft
                 clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was
                 possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at
                 16$\times$ coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects
                 would not be feasible using the MinION. Without increases in
                 accuracy, which would be required for applications such as
                 genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the
                 MinION appears limited. Library preparation requires access to
                 a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost
                 to that of other next-generation sequencing platforms. The
                 MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for
                 single-molecule sequencing, though it will require dramatic
                 decreases in error rates before it lives up to its promise.",

                 detects multiple bands ranging in molecular weight from 45 kDa
                 to >75 kDa. Expression screening putatively identified R3hdm2
                 as NeuN; however immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of
                 the two major NeuN species at 45-50 kDa identified both as the
                 RNA binding protein Rbfox3 (a member of the Fox family of
                 alternative splicing factors), confirming and extending the
                 identification of the 45 kDa band as Rbfox3 by Kim et al.
                 Mapping of the anti-NeuN reactive epitopes in both R3hdm2 and
                 Rbfox3 reveals a common proline- and glutamine-rich domain
                 that lies at the N-terminus of the Rbfox3 protein. Our data
                 suggests that alternative splicing of the Rbfox3 pre-mRNA
                 itself leads to the production of four protein isoforms that
                 migrate in the 45-50 kDa range, and that one of these splicing
                 choices regulates Rbfox3/NeuN sub-cellular steady-state
                 distribution, through the addition or removal of a short
                 C-terminal extension containing the second half of a bipartite
                 hydrophobic proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal.
                 Rbfox3 regulates alternative splicing of the Rbfox2 pre-mRNA,
                 producing a message encoding a dominant negative form of the
                 Rbfox2 protein. We show here that nuclear Rbfox3 isoforms can
                 also enhance the inclusion of cryptic exons in the Rbfox2
                 mRNA, resulting in nonsense-mediated decay of the message,
                 thereby contributing to the negative regulation of Rbfox2 by

                 paracrine signalling from these precocious cells. Notably,
                 preventing cell-to-cell communication also substantially
                 reduces variability between cells in the expression of an
                 early-induced 'peaked' inflammatory module, suggesting that
                 paracrine signalling additionally represses part of the
                 inflammatory program. Our study highlights the importance of
                 cell-to-cell communication in controlling cellular
                 heterogeneity and reveals general strategies that
                 multicellular populations can use to establish complex dynamic

                 This addresses the hypothesis that individual IMP protein
                 activities determine cargo nuclear access to influence cell
                 fate outcomes. We previously demonstrated that modulating
                 IMP$\alpha$2 levels alters paraspeckle protein 1 (PSPC1)
                 nuclear accumulation and affects its localization into a
                 subnuclear domain that affects RNA metabolism and cell
                 survival, the paraspeckle. An automated, high throughput,
                 image analysis pipeline with customisable outputs was created
                 using Imaris software coupled with Python and R scripts; this

                 technology in genomics, owing to its ability to detect single
                 DNA molecules without prior amplification, lack of reliance on
                 expensive optical components, and the ability to sequence long
                 fragments. The MinION™ from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)
                 is the first nanopore sequencer to be commercialized and is
                 now available to early-access users. The MinION™ is a
                 USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer that permits
                 real-time analysis of streaming event data. Currently, the
                 research community lacks a standardized toolkit for the

                 poretools, a flexible toolkit for exploring datasets generated
                 by nanopore sequencing devices from MinION™ for the purposes
                 of quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates

                 approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative
                 splicing. We previously developed multivariate analysis of
                 transcript splicing (MATS), a statistical method for detecting
                 differential alternative splicing between two RNA-Seq samples.
                 Here we describe a new statistical model and computer program,
                 replicate MATS (rMATS), designed for detection of differential
                 alternative splicing from replicate RNA-Seq data. rMATS uses a
                 hierarchical model to simultaneously account for sampling
                 uncertainty in individual replicates and variability among
                 replicates. In addition to the analysis of unpaired
                 replicates, rMATS also includes a model specifically designed
                 for paired replicates between sample groups. The
                 hypothesis-testing framework of rMATS is flexible and can
                 assess the statistical significance over any user-defined
                 magnitude of splicing change. The performance of rMATS is
                 evaluated by the analysis of simulated and real RNA-Seq data.
                 rMATS outperformed two existing methods for replicate RNA-Seq
                 data in all simulation settings, and RT-PCR yielded a high
                 validation rate (94\%) in an RNA-Seq dataset of prostate
                 cancer cell lines. Our data also provide guiding principles
                 for designing RNA-Seq studies of alternative splicing. We
                 demonstrate that it is essential to incorporate biological
                 replicates in the study design. Of note, pooling RNAs or
                 merging RNA-Seq data from multiple replicates is not an
                 effective approach to account for variability, and the result
                 is particularly sensitive to outliers. The rMATS source code
                 is freely available at rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/. As the
                 popularity of RNA-Seq continues to grow, we expect rMATS will
                 be useful for studies of alternative splicing in diverse
                 RNA-Seq projects.",

                 gene silencing on a global scale. Here, we perform
                 ``identification of direct RNA interacting proteins'' (iDRiP)
                 to isolate a comprehensive protein interactome for Xist, an
                 RNA required for Xi silencing. We discover multiple classes of
                 interactors-including cohesins, condensins, topoisomerases,
                 RNA helicases, chromatin remodelers, and modifiers-that
                 synergistically repress Xi transcription. Inhibiting two or
                 three interactors destabilizes silencing. Although Xist
                 attracts some interactors, it repels architectural factors.
                 Xist evicts cohesins from the Xi and directs an Xi-specific
                 chromosome conformation. Upon deleting Xist, the Xi acquires
                 the cohesin-binding and chromosomal architecture of the active

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: A-to-I RNA-editing mediated by ADAR (adenosine
                 deaminase acting on RNA) enzymes that converts adenosine to
                 inosine in RNA sequence can generate mutations and alter gene
                 regulation in metazoans. Previous studies have shown that
                 A-to-I RNA-editing plays vital roles in mouse embryogenesis.
                 However, the RNA-editing activities in early human embryonic
                 development have not been investigated. RESULTS: Here, we
                 characterized genome-wide A-to-I RNA-editing activities during
                 human early embryogenesis by profiling 68 single cells from 29
                 human embryos spanning from oocyte to morula stages. We
                 demonstrate dynamic changes in genome-wide RNA-editing during
                 early human embryogenesis in a stage-specific fashion. In
                 parallel with ADAR expression level changes, the genome-wide
                 A-to-I RNA-editing levels in cells remained relatively stable
                 until 4-cell stage, but dramatically decreased at 8-cell
                 stage, continually decreased at morula stage. We detected 37
                 non-synonymously RNA-edited genes, of which 5 were frequently
                 found in cells of multiple embryonic stages. Moreover, we
                 found that A-to-I editings in miRNA-targeted regions of a
                 substantial number of genes preferably occurred in one or two
                 sequential stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-cell analysis
                 reveals dynamic changes in genome-wide RNA-editing during
                 early human embryogenesis in a stage-specific fashion, and

                 important that splicing be deferred until all of the exons and

                 developed an in situ RNA imaging method with single-molecule

                 Using this approach, we found that the normally tight coupling
                 between transcription and splicing is broken in situations
                 where the intron's polypyrimidine tract is sequestered within

                 of alternative splicing, in which certain exons are skipped
                 due to the activity of the RNA-binding proteins Sxl and PTB,

  abstract    = "RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct
                 effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled
                 by RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds
                 and thus has motivated extensive computational and
                 experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing
                 approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely
                 limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces
                 which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to
                 predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of
                 RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence
                 which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an
                 approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native
                 conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This
                 method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate
                 (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine
                 residues, followed by deep sequencing to monitor
                 modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in
                 excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and
                 with the high-resolution crystal structure of the
                 Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo
                 and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there
                 are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in
                 vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in
                 cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in
                 regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure
                 under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that
                 energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the
                 predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our
                 studies broadly enable the functional analysis of
                 physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to
                 the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure
                 formed is the most thermodynamically favourable,
                 thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA

              exciting possibilities to address biological and medical
              questions, but a systematic comparison of recently developed
              protocols is still lacking. Results: We generated data from 447
              mouse embryonic stem cells using Drop‑seq, SCRB‑seq, Smart‑seq
              (on Fluidigm C1) and Smart‑seq2 and analyzed existing data from
              35 mouse embryonic stem cells prepared with CEL‑seq. We find that
              Smart‑seq2 is the most sensitive method as it detects the most
              genes per cell and across cells. However, it shows more
              amplification noise than CEL‑seq, Drop‑seq and SCRB‑seq as it
              cannot use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). We use
              simulations to model how the observed combinations of sensitivity
              and amplification noise affects detection of differentially
              expressed genes and find that SCRB‑seq reaches 80\% power with
              the fewest number of cells. When considering cost-efficiency at
              different sequencing depths at 80\% power, we find that Drop‑seq
              is preferable when quantifying transcriptomes of a large numbers
              of cells with low sequencing depth, SCRB‑seq is preferable when
              quantifying transcriptomes of fewer cells and Smart‑seq2 is
              preferable when annotating and/or quantifying transcriptomes of
              fewer cells as long one can use in-house produced transposase.
              Conclusions: Our analyses allows an informed choice among five
              prominent scRNA‑seq protocols and provides a solid framework for
              benchmarking future improvements in scRNA‑seq methodologies.",

                 its negative regulator Mdm2 (refs. 1,4-7): this system uses
                 functional p53-CFP and Mdm2-YFP fusion proteins and time-lapse

                 a new fluorescent protein-based approach to quantitatively
                 analyze the alternative splicing of a target cassette exon
                 (skipping or inclusion), which results in an open-reading
                 frame shift. A fragment of a gene of interest is cloned
                 between red and green fluorescent protein (RFP and
                 GFP)-encoding sequences in such a way that translation of the
                 normally spliced full-length transcript results in expression
                 of both RFP and GFP. In contrast, alternative exon skipping
                 results in the synthesis of RFP only. Green and red
                 fluorescence intensities can be used to estimate the
                 proportions of normal and alternative transcripts in each
                 cell. The new method was successfully tested for human PIG3
                 (p53-inducible gene 3) cassette exon 4. Expected pattern of
                 alternative splicing of PIG3 minigene was observed, including
                 previously characterized effects of UV light irradiation and

                 individual cells with at least two distinct populations with
                 ∼45\% and >95\% alternative transcript. We believe that this

                 catalyze the incorporation of fluorescently labeled
                 nucleotides into complementary nucleic acid strands. The
                 arrival times and durations of the resulting fluorescence
                 pulses yield information about polymerase kinetics and allow

  abstract    = "Classic deamination mRNA changes, including cytidine to
                 uridine (C-to-U) and adenosine to inosine (A-to-I), are
                 important exceptions to the central dogma and lead to
                 significant alterations in gene transcripts and products.
                 Although there are a few reports of non-classic mRNA
                 alterations, as yet there is no molecular explanation for
                 these alternative changes. Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) mutations and
                 variants are implicated in several diseases, including Wilms
                 tumor and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We observed two
                 alternative G-to-A changes, namely c.1303G>A and c.1586G>A in
                 cDNA clones and found them to be recurrent in a series of 21
                 umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) samples studied.
                 Two less conserved U-to-C changes were also observed. These
                 alternative changes were found to be significantly higher in
                 non-progenitor as compared to progenitor CBMCs, while they
                 were found to be absent in a series of AML samples studied,
                 indicating they are targeted, cell type-specific mRNA editing
                 modifications. Since APOBEC/ADAR family members are implicated
                 in RNA/DNA editing, we screened them by RNA-interference
                 (RNAi) for WT1-mRNA changes and observed near complete
                 reversal of WT1 c.1303G>A alteration upon APOBEC3A (A3A)
                 knockdown. The role of A3A in mediating this change was
                 confirmed by A3A overexpression in Fujioka cells, which led to
                 a significant increase in WT1 c.1303G>A mRNA editing.
                 Non-progenitor CBMCs showed correspondingly higher levels of
                 A3A-mRNA and protein as compared to the progenitor ones. To
                 our knowledge, this is the first report of mRNA modifying
                 activity for an APOBEC3 protein and implicates A3A in a novel
                 G-to-A form of editing. These findings open the way to further
                 investigations into the mechanisms of other potential mRNA
                 changes, which will help to redefine the RNA editing paradigm
                 in both health and disease.",

                 specific RNA recognition by export proteins. Specific RNA
                 recognition is usually achieved by specific RNA sequences or
                 structures, but we have recently reported a molecular
                 mechanism by which the formation of export RNP complexes is
                 specified by RNA length. ( 1) RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
                 synthesizes not only mRNAs but also shorter RNAs, including
                 spliceosomal U snRNAs. Although the key U snRNA export factor,
                 PHAX, can bind to mRNA in vitro, PHAX is excluded from mRNA in
                 vivo. The heterotetramer of the heterogeneous nuclear RNP
                 (hnRNP) C1/C2 specifically binds Pol II transcripts longer
                 than 200-300 nt, and funnels them into the mRNA export pathway
                 by inhibiting their binding by PHAX, whereas shorter
                 transcripts not bound by the heterotetramer are committed to
                 the U snRNA export pathway. Although this finding reveals a

                 genome and DNA methylome regulate each other, these omic

                 these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in these

                 should provide the number of DNA molecules in that cell and
                 their complete nucleotide sequences. We pose the formal
                 problem: can the genome sequence forming the genotype of a
                 given living cell be known with absolute certainty so that the
                 cell's behaviour (phenotype) can be correlated to that genetic
                 information? To answer this question, we propose a series of
                 thought experiments. RESULTS: We show that the genome sequence
                 of any actual living cell cannot physically be known with
                 absolute certainty, independently of the method used. There is
                 an associated uncertainty, in terms of base pairs, equal to or
                 greater than micros (where micro is the mutation rate of the
                 cell type and s is the cell's genome size). CONCLUSION: This

                 for the first time, and its analogy with the Heisenberg
                 uncertainty principle in physics is discussed. The genetic
                 information that makes living cells work is thus better

                 diversity in eukaryotes. However, how this affects protein
                 repertoires at a single-cell level remains an open question.
                 Here, we show that many 3'-terminal exons are persistently
                 co-expressed with their alternatives in mammalian neurons. In
                 an important example of this scenario, cell polarity gene
                 Cdc42, a combination of polypyrimidine tract-binding,
                 protein-dependent, and constitutive splicing mechanisms
                 ensures a halfway switch from the general (E7) to the
                 neuron-specific (E6) alternative 3'-terminal exon during
                 neuronal differentiation. Perturbing the nearly equimolar
                 E6/E7 ratio in neurons results in defects in both axonal and
                 dendritic compartments and suggests that Cdc42E7 is involved
                 in axonogenesis, whereas Cdc42E6 is required for normal
                 development of dendritic spines. Thus, co-expression of a
                 precise blend of functionally distinct splice isoforms rather

                 substantial cell-to-cell variability in mRNA and protein
                 numbers in otherwise identical cells. Recently, a number of

               steps, including alternative splicing and alternative cleavage
               and polyadenylation. In addition, certain mRNAs can be localized
               to distinct regions of the cell, contributing to protein
               localization and complex formation. This is particularly
               important in polar cell types, such as neurons. Although several
               hundred mRNAs are present in neuronal projections, only a
               handful of RNA sequences are known to target an mRNA to a
               particular location. Using mechanical subcellular fractionation,
               RNA-seq, and alternative splicing analysis, we have identified
               hundreds of mRNA regions associated with localization to
               neuronal projections in neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical
               neurons. These regions are overwhelmingly found in 3' UTRs, and
               in particular are associated with alternative last exon splicing
               events and result from a characteristic alternative isoform
               organization. Localization-associated 3' UTRs are shorter, more
               conserved, more gene-distal, and contain a higher propensity for
               secondary structure than other 3' UTRs. Furthermore, they are
               sufficient to direct reporter RNA into neuronal projections and
               are enriched in binding sites for trans-factors known to be
               involved in RNA localization. Knockdown of expression of these
               factors inhibits the localization of many transcripts. These

               expression as specific alternative splicing decisions in the

                 variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules
                 of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably
                 integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are
                 massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in
                 each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are
                 synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription
                 beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an
                 active state and ending when they transition back to the
                 inactive state. We show that these transitions are
                 intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors
                 such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover,
                 the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes
                 within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are
                 also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts
                 of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by
                 slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene
                 activation and inactivation was developed to explain the
                 statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that
                 increasing the level of transcription factors increases the

                 results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is

                 stochastic, pulses within the same cell. However, it has
                 remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic
                 interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here,
                 using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of
                 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile
                 transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate
                 their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse
                 timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed
                 activation in either a temporally overlapping or
                 non-overlapping manner during their transient response to
                 different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics
                 efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly,
                 under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1
                 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the
                 temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together,
                 these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene
                 regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is
                 common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results
                 suggest that it could also function broadly within the
